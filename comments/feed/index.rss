Why is gun safety and training unthinkable?  It&#039;s literally the opening line of the Second Amendment.  &quot;A well regulated Militia....&quot;  Pretty straight forward.  Can&#039;t get pass the training, go stand in the &#039;not a gun owner&#039; line.]]></description>

John, absolutely.  We do have landowners abstaining from the obnoxious spoiled brat routine and allowing access; incentivize that approach with tax breaks or similar. For those not cooperating with public landowners, Imminent Domain in either a 1-1 swap or simply cut a 25-yard path thru each corner, and pay the landowner the fair value, minus whatever they are receiving in USDA subsidies.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[As a member of Cease Fire Colorado, I&#039;m going to suggest what in Wyoming is unthinkable-- gun safety laws and mandatory  training. If the Thermopolis man  didn&#039;t have a gun and threaten or shoot the cop it&#039;s unlikely the cop would have killed him. And all for a drug charge?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Most of us respect the ranching community in the State of Wyoming. The rich western history of settlers moving West and homesteading a rough and rugged land in the late 1800&#039;s,  that only the toughest and relentless spirited types could possibly survive and succeed in. However, fast forward to the 21&#039;st century, we are faced with lands that have multiple uses, not exclusive to agriculture, oil, gas and mining. A multiuse system provides more economic benefits for the state, to think otherwise is not practical or rational. I contend that outdoor recreationalists, be it hikers, fishermen/women and hunters would generate more revenue to local communities than a cow/calf operation alone would, e.g., lodging, restaurants, fuel, etc.  I suggest the Stock Growers Association be more open-minded about this. They seem to be fine with oil, gas and mining, but opposed to any recreational use. Article VI, paragraph 2 of the U.S. Constitution, the &quot;Supremacy Clause&quot; refers to federal law taking precedence over any conflicting state law, you cannot argue this fact. The state legislators have a profound history of backing the stock growers in Wyoming and its understandable due to the state&#039;s ranching history. I&#039;ll finish with these two statements: If these property owners amidst the checker-board system, managed by the BLM are allowed to prohibit land access on public lands now, can we possibly imagine having any better chance of accessing these public lands under state ownership? Our Republican representatives want to sell federal lands to the states, fight these efforts by speaking out and attending public meetings and by voting them out of office!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[While the court decision favoring corner crossing is a huge plus, I do fear that harassment and intimidation by landowners will still occur. It&#039;s no secret that the Wyoming Game and Fish WGF is very pro large landowner and I do not foresee hunter harassment charges being issued to these landowners and their lackeys. Case in point, the Fred Eshelman thugs time and time again hazed and harassed the four Missouri hunters, even the bodacious ranch manager entered their tent without consent. WGF did nothing. In lieu of being protected by hunter harassment laws, don&#039;t be surprised if the harassment continues which may result in serious injury or death when a law abiding public land user stands their ground. WGF has long sold out to both the big land barons and the welfare cowboy cabal, so no wonder Mr. Jim Managna thinks he can still tweak and manipulate the court ruling into an advantage for the pennies per day grazing lease crowd]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;https://wyofile.com/wyoming-gop-to-select-new-leadership/#comment-464727&quot;&gt;Rev. Tim Lasseter&lt;/a&gt;.

Dear &quot;reverend&quot; (is that some ordained via the internet title you&#039;ve bestowed upon yourself?), you continue to titillate and amuse us with your constant and reliable drollery. The grand experiment of slithering into a new State and trying to fit in and be a big cowboy amongst the GOP with an economy version drover&#039;s hat failed on you the minute you crossed into Wyoming. It was over before it even started for the thrillbilly/hillbilly, &quot;reverend&quot; and perhaps the fine folks of the Ozark region would take you back, that&#039;s if you haven&#039;t already burned your bridges there. Go South, young man and take  Vince V. along with his support Emu with you.]]></description>

Rick- I live in Cody. Elk numbers are about 35% ABOVE in herd count over what Game &#038; Fish would like to see in all the Cody herd units. This after 30 years of Wolf packs  co-existing with Elk , and Grizzly numbers going up  as much as  300% since they were listed as threatened in 1975. No one knows the actual numbers, but it&#039;s not about number.. Just recall that every herbivorous species like Elk  Deer and Moose ( ungulates) have several companion carnivorous species  like wolves, bears, and cougars preying on them. Natural order of things.

I&#039;m just saying if you think grizzlies are drawing down local elk numbers, you are quite mistaken.  Barstool biology is not real science.]]></description>
