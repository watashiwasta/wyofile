Economist sees ‘disaster.’"></a></p>
<p>Gov. Mark Gordon said he sees &#8220;opportunity&#8221; for Wyoming in President Donald Trump&#8217;s tariff wars. At a press conference last week, he echoed the Wyoming congressional delegation&#8217;s praise for Trump&#8217;s economic policies as a tool to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and level the nation&#8217;s trade imbalance with much of the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Trump tariffs have kind of shuffled the deck, in a way, and I think it&#8217;s a great opportunity for Wyoming to be able to pick up the game,&#8221; Gordon told reporters while highlighting his April <a href="https://wyofile.com/governor-trade-mission-to-japan-taiwan-could-increase-wyoming-fossil-fuel-exports/">trade mission to Japan and Taiwan</a>. &#8220;Taiwan very much understood that they can buy more [U.S.] energy and that will help their situation in the trade deficit.&#8221;</p>



<p>But southwest Wyoming, the world&#8217;s largest exporter of natural soda ash, along with agricultural producers, businesses reliant on tourism and natural resource extractive industries across the state — as well as ordinary Equality State consumers of almost anything — have cause for concern, according to one Wyoming economist.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just no good way to spin the Trump administration&#8217;s economic policies in the short term,&#8221; University of Wyoming Associate Professor of Economics Rob Godby told WyoFile. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been disastrous, and they&#8217;re going to be disastrous.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

(Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The global oil market dominates much of the world&#8217;s economy and plays an outsized role in the nation&#8217;s economic pulse, especially Wyoming&#8217;s, Godby noted. So far, the market&#8217;s reaction is pointing to economic decline. That&#8217;s bad for Wyoming&#8217;s economy across the board, he said, and portends lower revenues to the state&#8217;s coffers.</p>



<p>Godby also serves on the state&#8217;s Consensus Revenue Estimating Group, which consists of the state&#8217;s top bean-counters tasked with estimating revenues to fund state and local governments. While tourism and agriculture play vital roles in the state&#8217;s revenue picture, Godby and his fellow CREG members closely monitor coal, oil and natural gas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to providing more than $2.4 billion in state revenues in 2023, the oil and natural gas industry supported nearly 59,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/energy-environment/exxon-chevron-earnings.html">U.S. oil prices have declined since Jan. 20</a>, when Trump began his second term in the White House, slipping by about 20% to around $56 per barrel over the weekend.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would say that the biggest effect on our revenues is really the indirect effect that will be caused by world oil prices, which is really driving down [Wyoming] oil revenues, especially in the last month and a half,&#8221; Godby said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not quite seeing it yet in terms of reported numbers, but we know it&#8217;s going to hit us because these prices are well below what we expected.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CREG group is on the front lines of measuring Wyoming&#8217;s vulnerability in international trade and the overall U.S. economy, according to Gordon&#8217;s office. Gordon&#8217;s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile, &#8220;We&#8217;re monitoring the tariff situation closely, which is constantly changing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meantime, there are more acute concerns for Wyoming regarding Trump&#8217;s tariffs and potential retaliatory responses among U.S. trade partners, Godby said.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trona and soda ash</strong></h4>



<p>Trona mined in Wyoming is processed into “natural” soda ash — a key component in the production of glass, baking soda and myriad other products. Wyoming’s trona and soda ash industry employs more than 2,000 workers, compared to about 4,100 direct jobs in Wyoming coal mining, according to the Wyoming Mining Association.</p>



<p>By far, soda ash is the state&#8217;s biggest foreign export commodity in terms of sales. Of Wyoming&#8217;s $2 billion in total exports in 2024, soda ash accounted for about $1.3 billion, according to Godby. China, Trump&#8217;s primary target in his tariff wars, typically accounts for about 10% of those soda ash purchases.</p>

<p>If the industry were to lose that 10%, it would be a significant blow, Godby said. What&#8217;s worse is the possibility that tariff wars might give a price advantage to synthetic soda ash, which Wyoming does not produce, and put a drag on exports to other nations.</p>



<p>&#8220;That could be a really significant impact on our [soda ash] exports,&#8221; he said, adding that it might even dampen plans for major expansions of trona mining and soda ash refining operations in the region.</p>



<p>WE Soda’s <a href="https://projectwest.com/">Project West</a>, a multi-billion dollar trona solution-mine expansion project now under construction near Granger, will create 2,000 temporary construction jobs, more than 400 permanent jobs and boost annual production by 3 million metric tons, according to the company. Pacific Soda&#8217;s proposed Dry Creek Trona Mine Project south of Green River, which has also crossed several <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2016395/510">regulatory approval milestones</a>, would bring in another 2,000 construction jobs and create about 300 full-time jobs, according to the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This vital development [the Dry Creek Trona Mine] will create hundreds of good-paying jobs for hardworking Wyoming families while strengthening our domestic supply chain for essential minerals that keep costs lower at the store for everyday Americans,&#8221; Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a prepared statement last week.</p>

<p>While the state&#8217;s trona and soda ash producers have been very &#8220;bullish&#8221; regarding exports in recent years, global dynamics for the commodities could change drastically if Trump&#8217;s trade wars escalate, according to Godby. Though the industry is not among the top three major influencers regarding the state&#8217;s overall revenue picture, &#8220;it does affect southwest Wyoming,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Though the industry may struggle in terms of past expectations to increase exports, Gordon said he hopes Trump&#8217;s policies might actually result in bringing glass manufacturing, which relies on soda ash, back to the U.S. and for the first time in Wyoming.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a long shot, but we&#8217;re really talking about bringing in glass manufacturers,&#8221; Gordon said, noting that he and his team visited with <a href="https://www.corning.com/careers/tw/en/careers/Locations/Taiwan.html">glass manufacturer Corning</a> while in Taiwan. &#8220;We talked about the possibility of being able to locate manufacturing here — a longtime dream of people in Wyoming. It may be a little bit more of an opportunity now with the backdrop of those tariffs.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oh, Canada, and China</strong></h4>



<p>Wyoming&#8217;s other vulnerability in international tariff wars is its reliance on Canada, the state&#8217;s largest international trading partner. The nation to the north accounts for about 20% of the state&#8217;s exports and 55% of imports, according to Godby. That translates into significant exposure for multiple goods, including robust trade of agricultural, manufacturing and heavy machinery components that both nations rely on in their natural resource extractive industries.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> &#8220;If you really wanted to sandbag the U.S. economy, you couldn&#8217;t have done much of a better job.&#8221;</p><cite>Rob Godby, University of Wyoming</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>&#8220;That clearly is going to have supply chain effects in terms of impacts on consumers, or impacts on what we produce, given the products that we bring in from Canada,&#8221; Godby said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If [Trump] gets tough with Canada, they&#8217;ll get tough back,&#8221; he added, noting the recent election of Prime Minister Mark Carney, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/americas/canada-election-results-carney-poilievre-intl-hnk">promises to rebuke Trump&#8217;s policies</a>. &#8220;Even though they know it hurts, they&#8217;re willing to do that, and Wyoming would be a victim of that trade war.&#8221;</p>



<p>Combined, Canada and China account for nearly 65% of Wyoming&#8217;s imports, according to Godby. &#8220;Clearly, Wyoming could be impacted much more than the nation as a whole, if we get into a kind of a trade dispute with those two countries.&#8221;</p>



<p>Still, based on his recent <a href="https://wyofile.com/governor-trade-mission-to-japan-taiwan-could-increase-wyoming-fossil-fuel-exports/">trade mission to Japan and Taiwan</a>, Gordon said he believes the tariff and trade policy negotiations serve as motivation for those markets — as well as others — to balance their trade deficits with the United States. Though he heard concerns about Trump&#8217;s tariffs and retaliatory trade policies, he also heard assurances that Japan and Taiwan are interested in balancing their trade with the U.S. Ways to do that could include importing more Wyoming-produced coal, natural gas, uranium and soda ash, as well as <a href="https://wyofile.com/why-wyoming-bar-nunn-crowd-seeks-info-on-plan-to-build-portable-nuclear-microreactors/">nuclear microreactors</a> that might be manufactured here.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Prime Minister [of Japan, <a href="https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/actions/202504/24hyoukei.html">Shigeru Ishiba]</a> said, &#8216;Look, we were [at an 80% trade imbalance with the U.S.] in the 1980s and now we&#8217;re less than 20%. So, you know, we&#8217;re anxious to work with you to rebalance,'&#8221; Gordon said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That type of interest includes potential investments by both Japan and Taiwan to expand port capacities in the U.S. and on their shores to increase the flow of Wyoming coal and natural gas to those and other Asian nations, he added.</p>



<p>Though Wyoming might see some new deals to ship energy commodities to Asian markets, Godby said, it would be despite escalating tariffs. The state may even land new manufacturing here at home, but those are long-term outcomes that first have to be built on investor confidence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hope is not a strategy,&#8221; Godby said. Even if the Trump administration pumps the brakes on tariffs completely, he added, there&#8217;s already a certain level of damage done to U.S. trade relations — and a big part of that is the fact that nobody knows what the Trump administration will do next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;With just general uncertainty, you&#8217;re going to see [investments] go down, which is going to hurt our economy. There&#8217;s no way to win that,&#8221; Godby said. &#8220;If you really wanted to sandbag the U.S. economy, you couldn&#8217;t have done much of a better job.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Wyoming Refinery in Newcastle has resumed operations months after an apparent explosion in February forced the facility to remain idle for repairs.</p>



<p>The refinery shut down following the Feb. 12 incident, which refinery owner Par Pacific of Houston called an &#8220;operational upset.&#8221; The company would not provide details of what happened beyond &#8220;the main crude heater needed to be replaced&#8221; and that there was an &#8220;unexpected and unavoidable equipment malfunction,&#8221; according to WyoFile interviews and company communications with state officials.</p>



<p>Weston County Emergency Management posted on Facebook the night of the incident that &#8220;a heater blew up&#8221; at the refinery.</p>



<p>No injuries were reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some fuel production resumed on April 21, it will be some time before the refinery is back to full capacity of 20,000 barrels a day, Dallas Scholes, Par Pacific&#8217;s government and public affairs director, told WyoFile.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you bring one of these facilities back online, you&#8217;ve got to take it slow,&#8221; Scholes said. Because the equipment has been idle for months, making sure everything is running correctly and safely takes time, from bringing the heat up to making sure the oil can move through. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot that is involved, and our No. 1 priority in this whole process is to make sure it&#8217;s safe, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re focused on.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company is not projecting when the refinery will resume full operational capacity, but it is providing updates on a <a href="https://newcastleheaterresponse.com/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJ_U9FleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETE0ZmpBUTBSVTV3cnNwMEZkAR7yxR0gJ0jAfQ9Qbgue5v8-cj5PwSELf4K74Uuupp_oo97D9-Am_HAhMF_xfA_aem_gAmVzz98t61FnE1o_e67Mg">website</a> dedicated to the incident.</p>



<p>Even with fuel production shut down, the refinery&#8217;s workforce has been hard at work, according to Scholes.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are some really incredibly hard-working people, and they were doing a lot of extra shifts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We used everybody we could on site, and we brought in a lot of really good experts to fill in the gaps and to make things work. They were gainfully employed the whole time. I&#8217;m really proud of what they were able to step up and do.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The facility produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and propane from Powder River Basin crude, according to the company. The economic impact on the region motivated Par Pacific to get the refinery back in operation as soon as possible, Scholes said.&nbsp;</p>

(Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;We stored a lot [of unrefined crude], but that is one of the reasons why we wanted to work as fast as we could — so that we can make sure that oil is still flowing and still available, and to make sure that our producers are still gainfully employed at the end of the day as well.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The ‘explosion’</strong></h4>



<p>The company doesn&#8217;t use the term &#8220;explosion&#8221; in public-facing communications, and instead refers to the incident as an &#8220;operational upset.&#8221; However, in a <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wyo-Refining-Co-letter-to-DEQ-March.pdf">March 24 letter</a> to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Health, Safety, Security &amp; Environment Manager Michael Baldwin wrote, &#8220;During the evening of Feb. 12, [the refinery] experienced an explosion in their crude heater … which resulted in a total shutdown of the refinery.&#8221;</p>



<p>The incident did not result in any liquid spills or significant airborne gaseous or powder emissions, according to the company. &#8220;There were no emissions that left our fence line,&#8221; Scholes said.</p>



<p>Regulatory officials are still in the process of investigating the incident in coordination with Par Pacific.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Things can go wrong, and we live every day doing everything we can to make sure that they don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><cite>Dallas Scholes, Par Pacific</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The cause of the incident remains unclear. The company has refused to elaborate. &#8220;That [information] has not been passed on to me,&#8221; Scholes told WyoFile.</p>



<p>In a written communication to DEQ, the company refers to an &#8220;unexpected and unavoidable equipment malfunction&#8221; that occurred at about 10:37 p.m. on Feb. 12.</p>



<p>Weston County Emergency Management Coordinator Gilbert Nelson, who has been briefed by the company multiple times since the incident, told WyoFile, &#8220;They were just trying to restart the heater and it went boom.&#8221;</p>



<p>Par Pacific is studying what happened to cause the heater failure, Scholes said. &#8220;Anytime an incident occurs, we&#8217;re all hands on deck to come do an investigation to look for lessons learned that we can apply to any of our other facilities.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oil and gas refineries can be a dangerous profession,&#8221; Scholes added. &#8220;Things can go wrong, and we live every day doing everything we can to make sure that they don&#8217;t. And we were just incredibly lucky, and we developed new systems. We do new checks. This is not something anybody wants to see repeated, so you can bet that we will do everything we can to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the days following, the company&#8217;s public updates noted a lingering cold snap and notified locals that they would likely see more steam than usual as crews used boilers to try to keep equipment from freezing. &#8220;It was 20 below zero when all this was going on,&#8221; Scholes told WyoFile.</p>



<p>The company also notified residents there would be more flaring than usual. Refineries frequently burn residual petrol vapors to reduce their hazardous effects, resulting in a flame at the top of a stack. Later, the refinery asked the state for permission, which was granted, to use a temporary boiler to prevent equipment from freezing, state documents show.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>History of incidents</strong></h4>



<p>The refinery is situated just south of West Main Street and a half-mile from Newcastle High School. The refinery was established in 1927, and officials are quick to point out that it was the <a href="https://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/newcastle-wyoming?utm_source=chatgpt.com">town</a> — at the edge of the Black Hills with a population of about 3,300 — that grew around it.</p>



<p>Par Pacific, which also operates refineries in Hawaii, Billings, Montana and Tacoma, Washington, acquired the facility in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under a previous owner in the 2000s, Denver-based Hermes Consolidated, Inc., the refinery was known for <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyo-refineries/">a series of mishaps</a>, including a March 2002 spill that rained 20 tons of silica catalyst over a portion of the town, resulting in a 2008 settlement with 47 Newcastle-area residents. Details of the settlement were not disclosed. In the latter part of that decade, the refinery received nine “notices of violation” from Wyoming DEQ, resulting in $427,400 in civil penalties.</p>



<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also took action against the refinery at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company paid a civil penalty of $150,000 in 2009 and agreed to invest $14 million in upgrades to settle several alleged emission violations cited by the EPA. In 2010, Wyoming Refining paid a $157,500 penalty to the EPA for “failure to prepare, submit, and implement an adequate and complete Facility Response Plan.”</p>

<p>Scholes said Par Pacific prioritizes safety and environmental compliance. &#8220;We have certain standards at Par that may not have been there before, and we are constantly working to improve operations.&#8221;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DEQ-2023-inspect-report-Wyo-Refinery.pdf">2023 Wyoming DEQ inspection report</a>, the most recent available, determined, &#8220;There were no noted concerns during these inspections.&#8221; The inspection report also listed the refinery as being in &#8220;substantial compliance.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The safety of our workers and the community is our No. 1 priority,&#8221; Scholes said. &#8220;We&#8217;re very proud of our employees that live in the Newcastle community, and they stepped up. They did great work in bringing this facility back to where it can eventually get fully online.&#8221;<br><br>From 2017 to 2022, Wyoming&#8217;s overall oil refining capacity shrank by 27% — from 177,500 barrels per day to 125,850, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/PET_PNP_CAP1_DCU_SWY_A.htm">according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration</a>. The state went from five oil refineries to four in 2021 when HollyFrontier Sinclair converted its Cheyenne oil refinery to produce “renewable diesel,” which uses agricultural products — not oil — to produce the fuel.</p>

<p>Gov. Mark Gordon recently joined several Wyoming business proprietors at a trade show in Taiwan, where Casper-based Backwards Distilling Company and Gillette-based Big Lost Meadery are highly regarded and very popular, he said. But the popularity of Wyoming spirits wasn’t the main thrust of the visit.</p>



<p>In both Taiwan and Japan, Gordon and other Wyoming dignitaries visited with business and ministry officials who are interested in Wyoming&#8217;s coal and natural gas, as well as strengthening partnerships to push carbon capture technologies to help those fossil fuels fit within their low-carbon-emission goals.</p>



<p>Both potential markets rely heavily on energy fuel imports, Gordon said, while officials in Taiwan believe that &#8220;about 20% of their energy mix is going to remain with coal and they&#8217;re very anxious to get Powder River coal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taiwan has its own elected government, but the People&#8217;s Republic of China claims it has sovereignty over the island off its coast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gordon called a press conference Wednesday to highlight his trade mission to the region earlier this month. He was joined by officials from the University of Wyoming, Wyoming Energy Authority as well as representatives from energy producers Jonah Energy, Williams Companies and coal-to-products company Kanata Clean Power &amp; Climate Technologies Corp.</p>



<p>&#8220;It builds confidence, which is very important in Asia,&#8221; Gordon said of the international talks. &#8220;And so this leads us to believe that there is a lot of very exciting opportunity.&#8221;</p>



<p>One primary tangible outcome Gordon hopes to come of strengthening ties with the two foreign markets is to reinvigorate efforts to build coal and natural gas port terminals to increase the international export of those Wyoming commodities. While the U.S. has increased its capacity to export liquified natural gas, efforts to expand coal ports, particularly on the West Coast, have faltered for years.</p>



<p>But Gordon believes that with public-private investment, along with policy support from President Donald Trump, those efforts will be revitalized.</p>



<p>It will require &#8220;looking at whether the Millennium Bulk Terminal can be reinvigorated, or Jordan Cove [terminal] or whether a couple of these other things in Oakland that have been talked about from time to time could come to fruition,&#8221; Gordon said. Increasing Wyoming&#8217;s fossil fuel exports might also require &#8220;going out of the Gulf of America [Gulf of Mexico] and going through the Panama Canal,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Asked whether the state&#8217;s trade efforts might help the beleaguered Kemmerer coal mine land export contracts in time to save it from potentially closing, Gordon said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a silver bullet for that right now. But I can tell you, I&#8217;m rummaging around in my ammo box for it.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Carbon capture hopes and Kemmerer coal</strong></h4>



<p>Kemmerer Operations LLC <a href="https://wyofile.com/kemmerer-coal-mine-lays-off-28-workers/">recently laid off 28 workers</a>, and many in southwest Wyoming worry there may be more job losses, or that <a href="https://wyofile.com/coal-layoffs-leave-wyoming-community-grappling-with-good-bad-of-energy-transition/">the mine might even close</a>.</p>



<p>The mine’s biggest customer — the nearby Naughton power plant, which accounts for about 42% of the mine’s coal production, according to federal documents — will stop burning coal by the end of the year as its owner, PacifiCorp, converts the plant to natural gas fuel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There remains a mix of hope and skepticism for two proposals to tap the Kemmerer coal mine for coal-to-products projects — potentially making up for the pending loss of the Naughton coal contract. In fact, an official from <a href="https://kanataclean.com/">Kanata Clean Power &amp; Climate Technologies Corp.</a> joined Gordon on the Japan and Taiwan trade mission.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="567" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?resize=780%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-112575" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?resize=1024%2C744&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?resize=768%2C558&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?resize=400%2C291&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer-1024x744.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Naughton coal-fired power plant and neighboring Kemmerer mine in western Wyoming. (Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The company proposes a multi-billion-dollar effort to cleanly convert about 1.8 million tons of Kemmerer coal annually into ammonia, primarily as an agricultural fertilizer. Another company, <a href="https://www.trisightglobal.com/about-us">TriSight LLC</a>, claims to have &#8220;unlocked&#8221; a process to convert the coal into myriad products, including graphite, agricultural fertilizer and makeup — using about 1 million tons per year from the Kemmerer mine, all while avoiding coal&#8217;s typical carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But neither project appears on the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council&#8217;s <a href="https://deq.wyoming.gov/industrial-siting-2/council/">working list of applications</a> — a required regulatory step for such projects. Taken at face value, the lack of an ISC permit application indicates that neither proposal is likely to consume Kemmerer coal within the next year or so.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Wyoming coal-to-ammonia project team is evaluating multiple siting alternatives, a list of alternatives that includes the Kemmerer mine surface lease,&#8221; F.E. “Wally” Wolski, who works with Kanata, told WyoFile via email.</p>





<p>Although WyoFile has not fully investigated the financial preparedness of either TriSight or Kanata, some southwest Wyoming officials regard both coal-to-products proposals as a potential lifeline for the mine. Kemmerer City Administrator Brian Muir told WyoFile that both projects underscore signs of a potential rebound in the coal market and the potential for technologies to find new uses for coal.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is not over yet,&#8221; Muir told WyoFile in March. &#8220;There&#8217;s years and years of coal reserves here, and technologies to convert [coal into products].&#8221;</p>



<p>Among the most exciting topics discussed on his trade mission to Japan and Taiwan, Gordon said, was an agreement to support coal technologies that reduce its carbon footprint.</p>



<p>&#8220;[We talked] about the progression of technologies that could go forward, and that generated a lot of excitement,&#8221; Gordon said.</p>

<hr class="wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity"/>



<p>On a cool morning in late February, Mark Fix was up before the sun to watch the Tongue River on his ranch in southeast Montana. He was concerned that a breaching ice dam could put his cattle and property in the path of rushing water carrying plates of ice the size of a dinner table.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>He was relieved to find that only his fencing and the riverbanks were damaged; his cattle were spooked but okay, he said. Across three decades of ranching on his property about 20 miles south of Miles City, Montana, Fix, who was born in Ekalaka, has grown accustomed to contending with threats from Mother Nature, but has also noticed them intensifying and accelerating.</p>



<p>“As I get older, it is harder to go through all of these unique climate change deals that we get hit with,” he said. About 10 years ago, a tornado ripped through Fix’s ranch, slashing through the roofs of his barn and home. He remembers winds reaching 100 miles per hour.</p>



<p>“I thought, ‘What the heck? We don’t have this kind of stuff in Montana.’”</p>



<p>In February, Northern Plains Resource Council, the Montana-based environmental organization Fix used to chair, joined other environmental groups and two tribes in a request filed with the U.S. District Court for Wyoming to allow them to join proceedings in a lawsuit against the Bureau of Land Management over two resource management plans the agency issued last year. The lawsuit, however, wasn’t intended to fight the BLM’s plans, but to make sure the agency defends them.</p>



<p>The plans, one in its Buffalo, Wyoming office, the other in its Miles City, Montana office, directed the BLM to stop issuing new coal mining leases in the Powder River Basin, a mineral-rich formation straddling southeast Montana and northeast Wyoming.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Northern Plains Resource Council was concerned that, with President Donald Trump back in the White House, the agency would not defend its resource management plans in court. It was joined by the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, whose reservation lies atop the formation in southeast Montana, a group of environmental activists from the Navajo Nation, which holds mineral rights in the basin, and other environmental groups who shared that concern.</p>



<p>Then, in April, Trump signed an executive order aimed at <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/reinvigorating-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-industry-and-amending-executive-order-14241/">rejuvenating U.S. coal</a>, which has been hemorrhaging jobs and revenue for decades as mining has become more efficient, and utilities have switched to cheaper ways of generating electricity, like natural gas and, increasingly, even-cheaper wind and solar. Trump directed the Secretary of the Interior to prioritize coal leasing as “the primary land use for the public lands with coal resources,” required federal agencies to consider “revising or rescinding” federal actions that would transition the nation away from coal and signed a <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16042025/power-plants-exempted-from-federal-mercury-limits/">proclamation loosening air pollution restrictions</a> for coal-fired power plants.</p>



<p>Coal mining appeared poised to make a comeback in the Powder River Basin.</p>



<p>A BLM spokesperson said in an email that the agency “is currently in the process of reviewing these resource management plans, as directed by relevant Executive and Secretarial orders,” and added in a separate email that “the BLM is committed to supporting the Trump administration’s prioritization of responsible energy development to make life more affordable for every American family while showing the world the power of America’s natural resources and innovation.”</p>



<p>Yet, burning coal is one of the most expensive ways of generating electricity, behind only nuclear energy and gas-fired “peaker plants,” according to one <a href="https://www.lazard.com/media/xemfey0k/lazards-lcoeplus-june-2024-_vf.pdf">estimate</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“We’ll continue to try and defend these plans until, essentially, they no longer exist.”</p><cite>Melissa Hornbein, Western Environmental Law Center</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The Trump administration is “seeking to undo [the two resource management plans] and they want to promulgate a new decision consistent” with Trump’s energy policy, said Melissa Hornbein, an attorney for the Western Environmental Law Center, which is representing several of the parties seeking to intervene in the Montana and Wyoming suit. Since Trump was sworn in in January, Hornbein said the federal government has been filing motions to stay cases that would require the Trump administration to defend policies enacted when Biden was president, which could happen in the effort to preserve the BLM’s Buffalo and Miles City resource management plans.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ll continue to try and defend these plans until, essentially, they no longer exist,” she said.</p>



<p>Wyoming is confident those plans will be replaced. In early March, state house lawmaker Scott Heiner, representing parts of Lincoln, Sweetwater and Uinta counties in southwest Wyoming, <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/03/06/lawmaker-announces-plan-to-build-next-generation-coal-fired-plant-in-wyoming/?utm_source=Klaviyo&amp;utm_medium=campaign&amp;_kx=9JURibOSG40Vs10QcnKFlneIuGBbtGSCcqHPVlvdLDlx2CdT-fhicfAJbOddWJMi.UXPtrV">told</a> Cowboy State Daily that Wyoming was beginning to study building a new “coal-fired plant” using $10 million in state-taxpayer dollars to help fund a yet-to-be-announced project.</p>

<p>“With the new administration, I think they will overturn that [resource management plan] in Buffalo,” the BLM field office that halted new coal leases in northeast Wyoming, “and I think there will be more opportunities to mine coal here in Wyoming,” he told Inside Climate News. Under Trump, Heiner sees “a chance to revitalize coal mining.”</p>



<p>The Powder River Basin, where mining companies report <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/peabody-reports-results-for-the-quarter-and-year-ended-december-31-2024-302369546.html">billions in annual revenue and hundreds of millions in profit</a>, produces 41% of U.S. coal, according to Energy Information Administration <a href="https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/coal/where-our-coal-comes-from.php">data</a> from 2022. For decades, while coal from the Powder River Basin was shipped across the U.S. as fuel for electricity plants, communities in Northeastern Wyoming benefited from the industry’s tax revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, the tensions between coal’s local benefits and its costliness, dirtiness and production of greenhouse gases warming the climate means it faces an uncertain future, even under the auspices of a friendly Trump administration, leading some communities in the region to begin trying to <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24062024/gillette-wyoming-coal-to-renewable-energy/">diversify their economy beyond the thermal coal industry</a>.</p>



<p>Still, for many on the ground, that future still includes mining coal.</p>



<p><strong>Defending &#8216;good decisions&#8217;</strong></p>



<p>Environmentalists and native groups who want to see the latest BLM resource management plans remain in place say that the environmental harms that come from mining and burning coal disqualify its continued extraction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For over 100 years we’ve been affected by different types of resource extraction on our land,” said Robyn Jackson, executive director with Diné C.A.R.E, an environmental nonprofit located in the southwest’s four-corners region within the Navajo Nation. Jackson, who is Diné, the tribal name for Navajo people, said any benefits from mineral extraction — typically from the Navajo leasing land to companies — pale in comparison to “the cumulative impact of that to our air, our water, our land and the public health.”</p>



<p>Even though Jackson does not live near the Powder River Basin, she is worried about the Navajo footprint there. Navajo Transitional Energy Company, an energy company whose sole shareholder is the Navajo Nation, has three coal mines in the Powder River Basin, whose coal spreads below the Crow and Northern Cheyenne reservations in Montana.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“​​We’re disappointed in the direction [NTEC is] taking of more fossil fuel development, of not limiting their carbon emissions — and especially with coal that does not seem to be a long-term source of revenue for our tribe” as demand for it continues to fall worldwide, Jackson said. “They need to be addressing the climate crisis, not emitting more carbon emissions, not emitting more greenhouse gases. And, really, they should be finding other sources of revenue that are going to be sustainable in the long term.”</p>



<p>The notion that one tribe could be detrimentally affecting another is part of the reason Diné C.A.R.E. has moved to defend the BLM’s decision to stop issuing future coal leases. NTEC’s operations in the basin are “exploitative towards other tribes and impacts their ancestral traditional lands, traditional cultural properties,” Jackson said.</p>



<p>The Northern Cheyenne, the Crow tribe and NTEC did not return interview requests.</p>





<p>Fix, the Montana rancher, is concerned that more coal mining will continue to worsen the effects of climate change, and he called the BLM’s decision to stop issuing new leases in the region “common sense” in a <a href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/legal-intervention-defends-powder-river-basin-coal-leasing-decision">press release</a> announcing the motion to intervene.</p>



<p>“This coal will probably never be developed because we’re going to renewables,” he said. “We got better ways to do things now than coal.”</p>



<p>While renewable energy has grown significantly in market share, natural gas has been the primary culprit for coal’s declining demand over the last decade.</p>



<p>If the Trump administration moves to stay the case or begins issuing new resource management plans in Miles City and Buffalo, a time-consuming endeavor, the environmental and tribal groups plan to continue fighting new coal mine leases.</p>



<p>“There were some good decisions that happened in the prior administration and we can’t let that go,” Jackson said.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>A Mining Rebirth?</strong></h4>



<p>There are some in the region who hope to see coal mining continue, even if it’s never used to generate electricity. The current BLM management plans are “not good plans for us,” said Rusty Bell, director of Gillette&#8217;s office of economic transformation, who is <a href="https://insideclimatenews.org/news/24062024/gillette-wyoming-coal-to-renewable-energy/">working on diversifying the region’s economy</a>. Bell said that Campbell County had received a grant from the Economic Development Administration under President Biden to build the <a href="https://www.energycapitaled.com/wyoming-innovation-center">Wyoming Innovation Center</a> in Gillette, which researches ways to use coal for commercially viable products, like bricks, instead of using it as fuel to generate electricity. Ending mining in the Powder River Basin contradicts that effort, Bell said.</p>



<p>“Why would they, you know, allow us to do research on our resource, and then tell us we can’t use our resource?” asked Bell. “It doesn’t make sense.”</p>



<p>Travis Deti, executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association, agreed with Bell. “We have to have access to our coal resource, and we have to have access to our resource far into the future,” he said.</p>



<p>Fix doesn’t want Powder River Basin coal mined for uses besides combustion. “A lot of our aquifers are in that coal,” he said. Mining removes water from the subsurface, limiting ranchers’ ability to water their cattle nearby. “It doesn’t matter what you develop it for, you still end up taking the water away.”</p>



<p>Deti estimated that current mining operations in the basin will cover the demand for its coal for the next 15 years, but almost all of that supply is already spoken for. New mining would pave the way for another coal plant to come online in Wyoming.</p>



<p>“It’s a pretty exciting time for the coal industry,” he said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Trump came in and gave carte blanche authority to the big coal corporations and said ‘the heck with all the little guys—all the guys working the land trying to make a living.’”</p><cite>Mark Fix, Montana rancher</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Such a facility would be the first new coal-fired plant built in the U.S. in over a decade, and would be the first in Wyoming to include carbon capture, potentially increasing the cost to consumers, but providing a new, marketable resource — carbon dioxide.</p>



<p>“CO2 is valuable, and it can be used,” Deti said. He pointed to “enhanced oil recovery,” whereby a company injects CO2 underground to stimulate an oilfield’s production, as such an example.</p>



<p>Deti said he does not necessarily believe carbon dioxide is contributing to climate change, but if limiting CO2 in electricity production is where the market is heading, “there’s no reason you can’t do it” to continue digging up and burning coal, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fix does not share Deti’s optimism.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Trump came in and gave carte blanche authority to the big coal corporations and said ‘the heck with all the little guys — all the guys working the land trying to make a living,’” Fix said. “Corporate America gets a bye, and the rest of us are going to have a hell of a time.”</p>



<p>He worries that more mining in the area will drive multi-generational ranchers off the land, but found some solace in the tricky economics of coal, which may keep mining companies from opening up new pits in the Powder River Basin. And he had a message for Trump and federal land managers who want more coal mining in the Powder River Basin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Stop giving handouts to the corporate coal mines,” he said. “Don’t just take care of your rich friends. Take care of everyone.”</p>

<p>CHEYENNE—A silver triangle rang out 45 times in the Capitol&#8217;s rotunda. Each ring commemorated a worker who went to work in Wyoming in 2023 and didn&#8217;t return home to their families because they were killed on the job.</p>



<p>About three dozen people — mostly from local unions — gathered for the Workers Memorial Day ceremony on a cool and wet Monday evening.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every person who goes to work deserves to come home,&#8221; said Marcie Kindred, executive director of the Wyoming AFL-CIO. &#8220;Every family deserves the peace of knowing their loved ones are protected. Every life lost is one too many.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Rev. Delaney Piper, pastor of Highlands Presbyterian Church, led the group in prayer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh God, we do not understand why deaths like this, that we remember, that we mourn today, occur,&#8221; Piper said. &#8220;More so, we do not understand why everyone — workers, business leaders and political leaders — don&#8217;t just join in taking decisive action to prevent future deaths and to protect workers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The annual event recognizes Workers Memorial Day, the anniversary of the 1970 <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/oshact/completeoshact">Occupational Safety and Health Act</a>. The measure, in response to the carnage of workplace fatalities, injuries and illnesses, is supposed to ensure safe work conditions. Though accidents do happen, Kindred said, far too many are entirely preventable and, collectively, they point to a systemic disregard for workers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Behind every workplace fatality lies a story [of a life] cut short too soon and a ripple of grief that continues long after the headlines fade,&#8221; Kindred said.</p>



<p>Kindred and other speakers noted that Wyoming&#8217;s 45 occupational fatalities in 2023 made it <a href="https://wyofile.com/labor-advocates-most-lethal-state-in-the-nation-for-workers-ignores-blue-collar-plight/">the deadliest state in the nation for workers</a> that year — a distinction Wyoming has held far too many times. Marcia Shanor, executive director of the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and a longtime worker advocate, said the annual commitment to demand safer working conditions appears to ring hollow among state leaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have committed, every single year for the last 20 years, to do better,&#8221; Shanor said. &#8220;And here we are, 20 years later, decades later, with one of the highest workplace fatality rates since 2007. It feels hollow to have to say those words that I have said every single year as we have remembered the great people who keep our state working.&#8221;</p>



<p>United Steelworkers Local 13214 President Marshal Cummings, who works at the WE Soda trona mine near Green River, believes Wyoming&#8217;s perpetual worker fatality epidemic is the result of a disregard for workers enshrined in its &#8220;<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/wyoming/title-27/chapter-7/">right-to-work</a>&#8221; laws. Such laws ostensibly protect employees from being forced to join a union. But, in Cummings&#8217; estimation, the laws are specifically intended to limit the power of unions, along with their persuasion to hold employers accountable for worker safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be very clear about this: right-to-work is a lie,&#8221; Cummings said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about jobs. It&#8217;s not about freedom. It&#8217;s about weakening the very organizations — our unions — that keep us safe.&#8221;</p>



<p>In states with right-to-work laws, workers see lower wages, fewer health benefits and weaker retirement security, according to Cummings.</p>



<p>&#8220;Most importantly, workplaces [in right-to-work states] are more dangerous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What is the right to liberty if you can&#8217;t speak up on dangerous conditions because you might be fired if you do? What&#8217;s the right to personal happiness if you&#8217;re trapped in a system where your work, your blood, your sweat, your tears, if your sacrifice is treated as disposable?&#8221;</p>





<p>For now, the Wyoming AFL-CIO is focusing its legislative efforts not on the state&#8217;s right-to-work laws, but on the larger and more immediate goal of improving workplace safety, according to Kindred. The union group, the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and other worker advocates see an opportunity to reignite past statewide efforts that had nudged Wyoming toward safer workplaces — efforts that seemed to fizzle out after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be one time a year that we all get together and talk about why this is an important issue,&#8221; Shanor said. &#8220;We should be having those conversations at the workplace, upstairs [in the House and Senate chambers], the governor&#8217;s office, and we should have leadership by our elected officials in helping us actually make steps forward that stay in place.&#8221;</p>

<p>In 2023, a worker died after falling through a skylight on a construction job. Another died after being thrown from a front-end loader. Yet another was buried in a trench collapse and two were crushed by vehicles they were either inspecting or repairing at the time, according to the <a href="https://dws.wyo.gov/dws-division/osha/fatal-accident-alerts/">Wyoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#8217;s fatal accident alerts website</a>.</p>



<p>The five &#8220;alerts&#8221; — limited to two sentences or less — belie the actual extent of occupational fatalities in Wyoming that year. Forty-five workers died on the job in 2023 — a 32.4% increase over the previous year and the deadliest since 2007, <a href="https://doe.state.wy.us/lmi/CFOI/toc.htm">according to the state&#8217;s most recent annual report</a> on workplace fatalities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless a <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/cops_courts/local/md-nursery-fined-for-mans-trench-death/article_e6c872b8-484b-11ef-804d-9bd23d4c70e4.html">local newsroom reports</a> on a workplace fatality, or there&#8217;s civil litigation, most victims&#8217; names disappear into the maw of multiple bureaucracies where extracting the type of information that might point to problem areas and potential solutions is frustratingly difficult, advocates and officials say.</p>



<p>“These aren’t just statistics — they’re our neighbors, family members and fellow Wyomingites,” Wyoming AFL-CIO Executive Director Marcie Kindred said in a prepared statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today is <a href="https://aflcio.org/about-us/conferences-and-events/workers-memorial-day">Workers Memorial Day</a>. Workers and their advocates <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/wyomingaflcio/event/775353/?referring_vol=10322276&amp;share_context=dashboard-event-details&amp;sharer_role=2">will gather at the steps of the Capitol</a> in Cheyenne beginning at 5:30 p.m. to commemorate the dozens of lives lost each year while on the job in Wyoming. The workplace tragedies are not only preventable but so frequent that Wyoming has ranked the worst or among the worst in the nation — on a per-capita basis — for decades, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/iif/state-data/fatal-injury-rates-by-state-2007-2023.htm">federal data</a>.</p>



<p>The state doesn&#8217;t appear to be on track to shed its deadly distinction.</p>



<p>Last year was comparably deadly, though there&#8217;s no official tally yet, and at least four workers have died on the job so far this year, according to Wyoming OSHA. They include: David Wesley Moore, 58, of Douglas, <a href="https://www.douglas-budget.com/news/article_99ac92d4-df81-11ef-8797-efe20024ffe0.html">killed in a natural gas compressor station fire</a> in Converse County; Alexander Harsha, 22, of Rock Springs, hit by a door that was struck by a forklift in Sweetwater County; Liam Cobb, 19, of Casper, <a href="https://www.douglas-budget.com/news/article_35ef5422-11cf-4497-91a6-c910dad5974b.html">died by suicide, falling from a wind tower</a> in Carbon County; and Denice Downing, 47, of Gillette, killed in a <a href="https://www.gillettenewsrecord.com/news/local/article_6d33a3f7-c880-41d7-9aa7-c6fa38d1c180.html">tanker-truck explosion</a> in Campbell County.</p>



<p>“Year after year, we gather [on Workers Memorial Day] to honor those we’ve lost, yet we see no meaningful improvement in workplace safety,&#8221; Kindred said. &#8220;We need concrete action to protect Wyoming’s workers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite the state&#8217;s December report confirming yet another notch to Wyoming&#8217;s dishonor as the &#8220;deadliest,&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t appear that the carnage — including the hardships families face — is a priority among elected officials. Past state-level initiatives, along with some industry-led safety efforts, seem to have fallen by the wayside, advocates say. Rather than a call to action to understand how to make Wyoming workplaces safer, Kindred said, worker advocates had to fight this year to defeat a <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/SF0175">measure</a> to reduce unemployment benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kindred said she recently told union members: &#8220;Your elected officials spent your taxpayer dollars arguing about pronouns and bathrooms. Meanwhile, we&#8217;re dying out here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Each year, the Wyoming AFL-CIO, along with the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, pleads with lawmakers to take on the worker fatality crisis as an interim topic, and each year, legislative leadership declines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we value workers in Wyoming like we should,&#8221; said Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association Executive Director Marcia Shanor, who has advocated for workplace safety for decades. &#8220;If we did, we would never tolerate 45 people being killed without asking about it.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s driving the crisis?</strong></h4>



<p>The 45 occupational fatalities in 2023 made Wyoming the most lethal state in the nation for workers on a per-capita basis — by a long shot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyoming recorded 16 fatalities per 100,000 workers, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/iif/state-data/fatal-injury-rates-by-state-and-industry-2023.htm">the most recent federal data available</a>. North Dakota was second at 9.8 deaths per 100,000 workers, and Mississippi followed at 6.9 deaths per 100,000 workers.</p>

<p>Agriculture, ranching and forestry were among the most deadly work sectors, according to the <a href="https://doe.state.wy.us/lmi/CFOI/toc.htm">state&#8217;s annual report</a>, followed by mining and oil and natural gas extraction. Across all industries, highway crashes and vehicular accidents accounted for 67% of all occupational fatalities in 2023.</p>



<p>At face value, workplace fatalities can appear to be &#8220;random&#8221; from year to year, according to Wyoming OSHA Program Manager Christian Graham. It&#8217;s tempting, he said, to point to Wyoming&#8217;s often-hazardous driving conditions, or unregulated ranch work, or employees shirking safety protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s so many instances where sometimes these can be prevented if we just slow down and pay attention,&#8221; Graham said.</p>



<p>Yet, it&#8217;s difficult to derive from data what exactly is behind Wyoming&#8217;s worker fatality problem, Graham cautioned. The labor, safety and workforce regulatory world is full of reductive reports and databases that, individually, don&#8217;t reveal root causes or how to address them. To understand and effectively address what plagues workplace safety, Graham said, requires deep, ongoing analysis and interaction with employers and employees. Wyoming OSHA and the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services do have those conversations with both employers and employees, he said. The agencies also oversee <a href="https://dws.wyo.gov/dws-division/osha/safety-health-consultation-compliance-assistance/">multiple programs</a> that go beyond inspections and enforcement to provide services such as safety training and voluntary consultations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;One death is too many,&#8221; Graham said, adding that more resources are always welcome. &#8220;We do our best while we&#8217;re out there to present our programs, and we&#8217;re completing our inspections throughout the state.&#8221;</p>



<p>Though workplace inspections and training programs are vital, the state does not do enough to hold employers accountable, Kindred said. She bristles when people chalk up the state&#8217;s track record to vehicle accidents and on-the-job suicides and homicides — which are included in the state&#8217;s tally.</p>



<p>&#8220;We also have the highest rates of suicide in the nation, and that&#8217;s a workers&#8217; issue,&#8221; Kindred said. &#8220;If they&#8217;re doing it on the job, these are deaths of despair because they&#8217;re at this job they hate that doesn&#8217;t pay enough and they can&#8217;t support their families.</p>



<p>&#8220;And if a lot of these [vehicle fatalities] are out-of-state truckers,&#8221; Kindred added, &#8220;we need to make sure they&#8217;re prepared. We need to be better neighbors. If people are sending their workers to Wyoming and they&#8217;re dying, that&#8217;s not the reputation we want.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s always a desire to pin the blame on workers for taking short cuts or not following procedures without acknowledging the pressures they&#8217;re under and things they don&#8217;t have control over, like improperly maintained equipment or the right tools for the job, said Tyson Logan, a partner at the Spence Law Firm, which specializes in workers&#8217; rights.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="520" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?resize=780%2C520&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-67877" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?resize=450%2C300&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ron Morgan stands for a portrait in front of his truck on March 21, 2020.

<p>&#8220;We see it all the time,&#8221; Logan said. &#8220;Wyoming workers are going out to do their job and being killed because of corporate negligence or recklessness. And what we see again and again is that companies just aren&#8217;t making their workers&#8217; safety a priority.&#8221;</p>



<p>Most employers provide proper training and equipment and encourage a culture of safety, Logan said, noting a slow cultural shift over decades.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s daunting, though. The problem is it&#8217;s not every company or every job,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When the economy is not as strong, companies tend to take more risks. When there&#8217;s fewer people, there&#8217;s more expectations and trying to do more with less. That&#8217;s when people get hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>There are myriad inherent on-the-job risks in Wyoming, including long commutes to remote locations and working around heavy equipment, said Rep. Lee Filer, a Republican from Cheyenne who owns a company that builds and operates data centers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every bit of the equipment they&#8217;re running, none of it is forgiving,&#8221; Filer said. &#8220;If it&#8217;s a forklift or front-end loader, that&#8217;s thousands of pounds hitting you. So it doesn&#8217;t take much.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite embracing safe workplace practices while serving in the military and as a union representative with the railroad, Filer admits he lost a fingertip to a saw blade due to his own recklessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did it myself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I do the best I can to make sure that my crew is safe. I always tell them, &#8216;Come let me know if you have a concern,&#8217; because I don&#8217;t want anybody getting hurt. And I&#8217;ve been pretty successful with that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Too many workers, however, feel they&#8217;re under pressure and don&#8217;t speak up, he said. His biggest worry is worker fatigue and commuting to and from work.</p>



<p>&#8220;It could be mandatory overtime issues where people maybe work 12 hours, 16 hours, then have to drive home,&#8221; Filer said. &#8220;Wyoming is always going to have a bad rap on this because of our shift work. A lot of our industries — the coal mines and railroads — those places are 24/7 operations.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s being done about it?</strong></h4>



<p>Beginning in the 2000s, a spike in fatalities and injuries that coincided with a coalbed methane and natural gas drilling boom spurred advocates like the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, Wyoming AFL-CIO and the Equality State Policy Center to increase pressure on leaders in Cheyenne.</p>



<p>The response wasn&#8217;t immediate. But eventually, the state organized special hearings and there was a genuine statewide discussion about how to make workplaces safer, according to Shanor, who played a key advocacy role. Industries responded, too, forming the <a href="https://dws.wyo.gov/wogisa-to-offer-leadership-training-in-casper-and-rock-springs/">Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance</a>, the <a href="https://dws.wyo.gov/dws-division/osha/osha-alliance/">Wyoming Transportation Safety Coalition</a> and a new safety training center in Casper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="446" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?resize=780%2C446&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-51950" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?resize=728%2C416&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?resize=745%2C426&amp;ssl=1 745w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Casper resident Lee Mosser (far right) testifies at a hearing with his attorney Hampton Young (center), while attorney Amy Taheri represents Wyoming Workers&#8217; Compensation in 2016. (Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>There were even modest reforms — which were hard-fought, Shanor said — such as an annual cost-of-living adjustment and an increase in death benefits under the Wyoming Workers&#8217; Compensation program. The Legislature in 2014 <a href="https://wyofile.com/lawmaker-time-consider-stiffer-osha-penalties/">considered increasing fines and penalties</a> for egregious safety violations to dissuade what some referred to as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/issue-343/disposable-workers-of-the-oil-and-gas-fields/">disposable worker</a>&#8221; attitude among some employers in the region. The state even created an occupational epidemiologist position at Wyoming Workforce Services to not only analyze workplace fatality and injury data, but to coordinate information among multiple, siloed agencies that investigate worker fatalities to help identify strategies to do something about it.</p>



<p>The drive to finally address Wyoming&#8217;s workplace fatality epidemic, however, petered out, Shanor said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance is no longer active, according to Wyoming OSHA, and the Wyoming Transportation Safety Coalition is trying to regain footing. The state recently reclassified the occupational epidemiologist post to an &#8220;OSHA compliance assistance position,&#8221; which means the state is no longer performing the deep analysis of root causes like it had in the past.</p>



<p>OSHA defended the changes as enhancing “our ability to support health and safety throughout the state by guiding rule and standard development, conducting outreach, and being an accessible resource.”</p>



<p>But Shanor, the workforce safety advocate, doesn’t see it that way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a huge loss,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just think we lack leadership,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I worry that maybe we let them off the hook after COVID.&#8221;</p>

(Wyoming AFL-CIO)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Kindred, of the AFL-CIO, was more blunt.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Wyoming leaders] like to talk about our work ethic and how we love our workers; We get the job done and we don&#8217;t complain,&#8221; Kindred said. &#8220;But when it comes time to put our policies and our efforts where our mouth is, we just want workers to be our mascot. We don&#8217;t really want to support them in any way.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s disheartening, Kindred added, because Wyoming really is the place where people will pull over to help a stranger broken down on the side of the road. &#8220;That&#8217;s why our continued inaction on workplace safety is so jarring. It contradicts our fundamental values.&#8221;</p>



<p>Filer, who served on the Labor, Health and Social Services Committee during his first stint in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2014, said he&#8217;s seen a shift in the Legislature from solving Wyoming problems to adhering to ideology.</p>



<p>&#8220;Worker safety, to me, is not an ideology or political position,&#8221; Filer said. &#8220;It&#8217;s something that everybody can probably agree on — that everybody wants to come home to their family when they get off work.&#8221;</p>





<p>Filer said he&#8217;s in favor of asking for more detailed reports, analysis and ideas from Wyoming Workforce Services and Wyoming OSHA, and generally prioritizing the workplace fatality epidemic at the Legislature. While he&#8217;s adamantly opposed to regulations, some are necessary, like &#8220;OSHA laws,&#8221; Filer said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a reason those [laws] are on the books. It&#8217;s because they were written in blood.&#8221;</p>



<p>Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee Co-Chair Rep. Landon Brown, a Republican from Cheyenne, said he wants the panel to take up the worker transportation safety issue this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Labor Committee co-chairs Sen. Eric Barlow of Gillette and Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams of Cody, both Republicans, did not respond to WyoFile&#8217;s inquiry about whether the committee will take on the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among the committee&#8217;s proposed topics this year, however, is to consider lowering — again — what employers pay into the workers&#8217; compensation program to &#8220;promote a more business-friendly environment&#8221; and &#8220;random&#8221; drug and alcohol testing of employees at state-funded institutions.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is time to reenergize this conversation and return worker safety to the forefront where it belongs,&#8221; Shanor said. &#8220;This silence is not just troubling; it is unacceptable.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Millions of dollars are at stake for oil and gas producing counties in a case before the Wyoming Supreme Court to decide whether a sales tax exemption applies to companies that used electricity to move their products from wellheads to a point of sale.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Department of Revenue is asking the Wyoming Supreme Court to overturn a 2024 State Board of Equalization ruling in favor of Merit Energy Company, which says it is entitled to a $3 million sales tax refund — in addition to earlier refunds — for the electrical power it purchased from 2020 through 2023 to transport oil and gas via pipeline.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Entangled in the lawsuit is electrical provider PacifiCorp, which seeks to collect the refund on Merit&#8217;s behalf. If the court sides with PacifiCorp and Merit, it could financially burden local governments that have received sales tax revenues based on the Department of Revenue&#8217;s interpretation of the sales tax exemption.</p>



<p>Park County officials, for example, said last year they were stunned to learn that local governments there might have to repay about $743,000, <a href="https://www.powelltribune.com/stories/53-million-refunded-to-producer,116729">the Powell Tribune reported</a>.</p>



<p>If Merit wins, other oil and gas companies will likely file for similar refunds, resulting in revenue &#8220;clawbacks&#8221; to the tune of &#8220;millions of dollars, but not tens of millions,&#8221; impacting most counties where there&#8217;s oil and gas production, according to a Department of Revenue official.</p>

(Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>No matter which way the court rules, Merit&#8217;s view of the sales tax exemption will be enshrined in state statute, beginning July 1. <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/HB0311">House Bill 311, &#8220;Exemption for transported fuel and power sales-amendments</a>,&#8221; passed earlier this year, clarifies that such utility expenses qualify.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>&#8216;Transportation&#8217; or &#8216;gathering&#8217;?</strong></h4>



<p>The soon-to-be-outdated state <a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/wyoming/title-39/chapter-15/article-1/section-39-15-105/">sales tax exemption</a> in question before the court applies to &#8220;Sales of power or fuel to a person transporting tangible personal property by railroad or by pipeline when the power or fuel is consumed directly in generating motive power for actual transportation purposes.&#8221;</p>



<p>The case hinges on whether or not Merit — and presumably other oil and gas producers in the state — qualify as a &#8220;transportation&#8221; company when it comes to moving their products to purchase points in the pipeline network.</p>



<p>Merit, one of the top oil and gas producers in the state, says the Department of Revenue has waffled on the classification, arguing on some occasions that oil and gas producers are in the business of transporting goods while also arguing they are not primarily transportation companies.</p>





<p>&#8220;Merit is in the oil and gas transportation business,&#8221; Merit attorneys wrote in a <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Brief-of-Appellee-Merit-Energy-Company-LLC.pdf">brief</a> filed with the court on Monday. &#8220;It gets paid to transport other entities’ oil from wellheads to a point of sale. Merit is thus no different than an interstate trucking company or a railroad, except that instead of using trucks and roads or locomotives and rails, Merit uses submersible electric pumps and pipelines.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Department of Revenue, in a March <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Brief-Petitioner.pdf">brief</a>, noted that Board of Equalization Vice-Chairman Martin L. Hardsocg dissented in the board&#8217;s ruling. Rather than transporting, according to Hardsocg&#8217;s dissent, Merit is in the business of &#8220;gathering&#8221; petrol commodities, which is more closely tied to production.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because Merit&#8217;s primary function is to operate various units and produce and sell oil and gas, including moving oil through a gathering system, it does not meet the statutory requirements for the exemption because it is not in the business of transporting oil through a pipeline,&#8221; according to the department&#8217;s brief.</p>



<p>No hearing dates have been set in the case initiated in January.</p>

<p>Thousands of Rocky Mountain Power residential customers will see their monthly electric bills jump by about $14 beginning in June.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Wyoming Public Service Commission approved the rate hike Tuesday, the latest in a series of increases by a company that has pointed to fossil fuel market volatility, <a href="https://wyofile.com/electric-utilities-may-win-immunity-for-system-sparked-wildfires/">skyrocketing insurance for wildfire liability</a> and major investments in renewable energy for the rising costs.</p>



<p>The three-member commission voted unanimously to accept a <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Rocky-Mountain-Power-et-al-proposed-settlement-March-2025.pdf">settlement agreement</a> struck between Rocky Mountain Power, its largest industrial customers in the state and the Wyoming Office of Consumer Advocate. The deal reduced the utility&#8217;s original request for a $123.5 million increase, or 14.7%, to an increase of about $85.5 million, or 10.2%.</p>



<p>Those figures could change slightly, based on a handful of minor stipulations to the agreement. The commission&#8217;s final order will be issued in a few weeks, potentially changing some calculations.</p>



<p>Commissioners acknowledged that, although they don&#8217;t like to see continuing rate hikes, the company is essentially responding to rapidly changing market forces, as well as diverging federal and regional policies that drive up the utility&#8217;s costs and ultimately impact customer rates.</p>

<p>Affordability, Commissioner Mary Throne said, &#8220;is a challenge — and it&#8217;s a challenge across the [electric utility] sector. I think it&#8217;s time we have sort of a global discussion about affordability and bring in the relevant stakeholders.&#8221;</p>



<p>Because Rocky Mountain Power is part of PacifiCorp&#8217;s larger, six-state service region, the utility must comply with renewable energy requirements that many in Wyoming regard as &#8220;unwise,&#8221; according to Commission Deputy Chairman Chris Petrie.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think many of those [Rocky Mountain Power and PacifiCorp] decisions represent the utility&#8217;s best effort to continue to provide the required service and to control their costs, as best they can, while complying with other pressures exerted on them,&#8221; Petrie said. &#8220;We certainly have to acknowledge that there have been significant rate increases that are welcomed by nobody.&#8221;</p>



<p>The utility’s customers also experienced a <a href="https://wyofile.com/historic-electric-rate-hike-whittled-to-5-5-after-utility-admits-error/">5.5% general rate increase</a> in January 2024, as well as a pair of <a href="https://wyofile.com/under-pressure-rocky-mountain-power-trims-fuel-cost-rate-hike/">temporary upward fuel cost adjustments</a> over the past two years.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Unresolved issues</strong></h4>



<p>Commissioners agreed that the approved rate hike settlement, even with their added stipulations, likely won’t forestall the utility asking for yet another rate increase in the near future.</p>



<p>Before the company makes another request, however, the panel encouraged it to make good on a promise to &#8220;workshop&#8221; those issues with stakeholders, including the Wyoming Office of Consumer Advocate and the Wyoming Industrial Energy Consumers group — the intervening parties that hashed out the settlement agreement with Rocky Mountain Power.</p>





<p>For example, Rocky Mountain Power and its parent company PacifiCorp have relied for years on a &#8220;multi-state protocol&#8221; group of stakeholders to hash out how to divide systemwide expenses and infrastructure investments among the six states where PacifiCorp operates. But under pressure from some states, PacifiCorp has signaled its intent to possibly dump the multi-state protocol process and replace it with a more piecemeal approach.</p>



<p>In fact, <a href="https://wyofile.com/pacificorp-mulls-breakup-that-could-align-wyoming-with-other-pro-coal-states/">PacifiCorp has contemplated</a> a &#8220;corporate realignment,&#8221; or breakup, in an effort to better respond to pro-fossil fuel policies favored in states like Wyoming and Utah and cleaner energy policy demands in states like California, Oregon and Washington.</p>



<p>Another matter to &#8220;workshop&#8221; is increasingly expensive wildfire liability insurance and litigation costs and how to fairly plan for those expenses, according to the commission.</p>

<p>The action stems from a years-long battle over whether federal land managers should weigh climate and health implications of drilling.</p>

<p>The Trump administration will forgo an environmental review for thousands of federal oil and natural gas leases, including some in Wyoming, at the center of a 10-year legal and political battle.</p>



<p>The Interior Department <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/interior-will-no-longer-pursue-lengthy-analysis-oil-and-gas-leasing-decisions-seven">announced</a> Thursday it will rescind a last-minute Biden-era notification to conduct a full <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/16/2025-00854/intent-to-prepare-an-environmental-impact-statement-for-the-oil-and-gas-leasing-decisions-in-seven">environmental impact statement</a> review for 3,244 oil and gas leases issued between 2015 and 2020 in seven western states. There are other review processes, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, to legally satisfy the cumulative court orders and settlement agreements stemming from the years-long battle.</p>



<p>BLM published its <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/04/11/2025-06241/intent-to-prepare-an-environmental-impact-statement-for-the-oil-and-gas-leasing-decisions-in-seven">official notice</a> to ditch the review in the Federal Register on Friday. The BLM &#8220;is evaluating options for compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act for these oil and gas leasing decisions,&#8221; according to the agency.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One group involved in the decade-long legal battle questioned that approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t know what that&#8217;s going to look like or, honestly, if it will even happen,&#8221; WildEarth Guardians Climate and Health Advocate Melissa Troutman told WyoFile on Thursday.</p>

<p>WildEarth Guardians initially sued the BLM in 2016, pressuring the agency to more fully analyze the cumulative climate and health implications of its oil and gas leasing actions. The conservation group is particularly &#8220;dialed into&#8221; BLM&#8217;s environmental role in the prolific Permian Basin oil and gas field that spans New Mexico and western Texas — one of the most intense drilling plays in the nation, Troutman said. But WildEarth Guardians and other groups have condemned the federal agency for what they see as its capitulation — via piecemeal environmental reviews — to the industry&#8217;s larger pollution from activities on federal lands throughout the West.</p>



<p>As multiple lawsuits and differing court rulings ensued over the years, the BLM has been whipsawed by changing presidential administrations with vastly differing directives over the issues.</p>



<p>&#8220;Meanwhile, more climate pollution, more families in these frontline communities [face health implications], more spills contaminating land and water are occurring every day,&#8221; Troutman said. &#8220;This is not the time to delay a further assessment of what&#8217;s already happening.&#8221;</p>



<p>She added: &#8220;This whole plan to &#8216;unleash American energy&#8217; is really just unleashing even more oil and gas pollution on top of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Industry officials contend the leases in question, and their environmental impacts, have been analyzed ad nauseam.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The court[s], in these cases, are requiring some level of review. The BLM must follow the law,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming President Pete Obermueller told WyoFile via email.&nbsp;</p>





<p>But he stressed, the Biden administration&#8217;s approach wasn’t the best route.</p>



<p>&#8220;A multi-state [environmental impact statement] is not the only way to undertake environmental analysis,&#8221; he wrote&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Interior Department, which oversees the BLM, noted the action to rescind the Biden administration&#8217;s promise for a full environmental review — which would have included cumulative climate and health impacts — is in line with President Donald Trump&#8217;s January executive order, &#8220;<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/01/unleashing-american-energy/">Unleashing American Energy</a>.&#8221; The order directs the Interior and other federal agencies to, among other things, reduce &#8220;regulatory barriers for oil and gas companies and [expedite] domestic energy development.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meantime, the BLM is moving forward with <a href="https://www.blm.gov/programs/energy-and-minerals/oil-and-gas/leasing/regional-lease-sales/wyoming">quarterly oil and gas lease sales</a>. The agency this month initiated a 30-day &#8220;public scoping period&#8221; seeking input on 99 oil and gas lease parcels in Wyoming that it may include in a December lease sale. The comment period ends May 9. <br><br>For information, maps and instructions for how to comment, go to this <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2037704/510">BLM webpage</a>.</p>

<p>To the delight of Wyoming&#8217;s top elected officials, President Donald Trump signed a series of executive orders Tuesday to &#8220;reinvigorate&#8221; U.S. coal, but whether deregulation can change the tide of market forces remains to be seen. During Trump&#8217;s first term in office, the coal industry continued to <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=55319">lose most of its electric utility market share to natural gas</a> and spiraled into a <a href="https://wyofile.com/is-prb-coal-headed-for-gradual-decline-or-sheer-cliff/">series of bankruptcies</a>.</p>



<p>The orders will restore &#8220;beautiful, clean coal,&#8221; according to the White House, by &#8220;removing federal regulatory barriers that undermine coal production, encouraging the utilization of coal to meet growing domestic energy demands, increasing American coal exports, and ensuring that federal policy does not discriminate against coal production or coal-fired electricity generation.&#8221;</p>



<p>At Trump&#8217;s invitation, Gov. Mark Gordon was on hand at the White House to celebrate the signing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is a great day for Wyoming coal,” Gordon said Tuesday in a prepared statement. “We produce more coal than any other state in the nation. These executive orders will be impactful for our state’s coal industry and will help ensure Wyoming coal is available to help meet our nation’s growing energy demand.”</p>

<p>Likewise, Sen. Cynthia Lummis attended the event and lauded the president’s embrace of coal.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wyoming stands ready and able to support President Trump&#8217;s initiative,&#8221; Lummis said in a prepared statement. “The previous administration&#8217;s anti-science, anti-energy, anti-Wyoming policies cost good paying jobs, increased energy costs and played into the hands of America&#8217;s adversaries.&#8221;</p>



<p><a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/reinvigorating-americas-beautiful-clean-coal-industry-and-amending-executive-order-14241/">The orders</a> direct federal agencies to lift perceived regulatory barriers to coal mining and direct the Bureau of Land Management to &#8220;prioritize coal leasing and related activities, consistent with applicable law, as the primary land use for the public lands with coal resources.&#8221; Trump will also use his presidential emergency authority to allow utilities to continue operating coal-burning electric generation facilities previously scheduled for retirement. The president’s orders also exempt, for two years, coal plants from previous federal requirements to reduce toxic emissions, including for arsenic, mercury and benzene.</p>



<p>The actions, according to the Trump administration, are necessary to assert &#8220;American energy independence&#8221; and to ensure U.S. coal will help meet &#8220;the rise in electricity demand due to the resurgence of domestic manufacturing and the construction of artificial intelligence data processing centers.&#8221;</p>



<p>How quickly the sweeping actions might slow or reverse more than 15 years of policy and market shifts away from coal and toward natural gas, wind and solar energy remains to be seen, according to <a href="https://wyofile.com/facing-headwinds-wyoming-coal-industry-cautiously-optimistic-about-trump-administration/">some industry analysts</a>. Regardless, many coal-reliant utilities have already delayed or erased coal plant retirement dates in recent months, including PacifiCorp, <a href="https://wyofile.com/pacificorp-throws-lifeline-to-one-wyoming-power-plant-confirms-end-of-coal-at-another/">which operates several coal-fired units in Wyoming</a>.</p>



<p>Conservation groups were quick to condemn Trump&#8217;s actions.</p>

<p>“Like his recent tariffs, the executive order that President Trump signed [Tuesday] presumes Americans are living in the distant past,&#8221; Western Organization of Resource Councils Board Chair Barbara Vasquez said. &#8220;It makes no economic, financial, or market sense and is simply a gift to corporate polluters that rural communities will have to pay for through higher electric bills, worsened air quality and toxic pollution of public lands and waters.”</p>



<p>Conservation groups also note that last year was <a href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/2024-was-nations-warmest-year-on-record">the hottest on human record</a>, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and that Trump&#8217;s actions threaten to throw a wrench into efforts to reduce human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.</p>



<p>“Donald Trump is hell-bent on dragging the United States back to the 19th century, complete with robber barons, smokestacks, crippling tariffs and measles,&#8221; Center for Western Priorities Policy Director Rachael Hamby said. &#8220;The free market has already made it clear that renewable energy sources are a cheaper and healthier path to meet America’s energy needs.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Climbing out of the pit</strong></h4>



<p>The Interior Department responded immediately, directing its Bureau of Land Management on Tuesday <a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/department-interior-moves-restore-coal-industry">to resume leasing federal coal in the Powder River Basin</a> — the nation&#8217;s largest coal-producing region overlying northeast Wyoming and parts of Montana.</p>

<p>“The Golden Age is here, and we are starting to ‘Mine, Baby, Mine’ for clean American coal,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said. “Interior is unlocking America’s full potential in energy dominance and economic development to make life more affordable for every American family while showing the world the power of America’s natural resources and innovation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The BLM, under the Biden administration <a href="https://wyofile.com/feds-on-track-to-finalize-coal-leasing-ban-despite-wyoming-industry-protests/">in 2024</a>, issued its <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2021239/510">final supplemental environmental impact statement and proposed amendment</a> to land use plans directing its Buffalo and Miles City, Montana, field offices, to select a “no future coal leasing alternative.” It justified the move, in part, by noting that coal companies had not nominated a major new federal coal lease in the region in more than 10 years and that existing leases would allow mining to continue through 2041.</p>



<p>Wyoming and Montana <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-montana-sue-feds-to-repeal-powder-river-basin-coal-leasing-ban/">sued the BLM in December</a>, seeking to overturn the leasing ban. Now that the agency appears to be rolling back the ban under Trump&#8217;s directive — while the matter is still before the courts — it remains unclear whether mining companies in the region will produce more coal or nominate federal coal for new leases.</p>



<p>For now, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=64924&amp;utm_source=chatgpt.com">U.S. coal remains in decline</a>, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The production decline, at least for the next year or so, will remain most prominent in the Powder River Basin, according to industry analyst group McCloskey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the same time, however, forecasts for skyrocketing electricity demand in the U.S. provide hope for Powder River Basin producers, who rely almost entirely on the nation&#8217;s fleet of coal plants.</p>



<p>&#8220;The electricity demand that these data centers require — right now it represents roughly about 4% of the electricity produced in the United States,&#8221; McCloskey Data Analytics Director Andrew Blumenfeld said during a webinar in March. &#8220;That is expected to grow to 12% of the electricity demand in the United States by 2028 — a mere three years from now.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a recent quarterly report call with investors, Peabody Energy — Wyoming&#8217;s largest coal producer — said that it is being approached by data center developers to explore deals for coal contracts, in some cases, to potentially build their own dedicated coal-fired power generation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Is coal the future of American energy?</strong></h4>



<p>Gordon has long touted using coal as a stepping stone to prove carbon capture technologies at commercial scale — an essential strategy, he says, to keep Wyoming coal in the nation&#8217;s energy mix while minimizing the coal-fired electric utility industry&#8217;s carbon dioxide emissions.</p>



<p>“While the [executive orders] are a great first step, the real focus must not only be extending the life of coal-fired generating plants nearing retirement, but to actually pave the way to building new power plants,” Gordon said. “These are essential to our future. Wyoming is ready to lead the way and be a partner in that process.</p>

<p>&#8220;I encourage all Wyoming utility companies to carefully examine the possibilities provided in these [executive orders],&#8221; Gordon added, &#8220;in order to increase the use of coal and other sources of electricity to see that Wyomingites and other consumers have affordable, reliable and dependable energy.”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, conservation groups argue that fast-tracking fossil fuel production and consumption by eliminating regulatory checks is unnecessary in light of continually more efficient and affordable renewable energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;We can meet that [increasing electricity] demand through a combination of renewable energy and [power] storage resources — that&#8217;s where we should be making our investments,&#8221; Earthjustice Managing Attorney for the Northern Rockies Regional Office Jenny Harbine told WyoFile. &#8220;This false narrative that coal is the fuel of the future is as deceitful as it is harmful.&#8221;</p>





<p>The U.S. coal industry&#8217;s decline, Harbine added, is not due to federal policies. &#8220;It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s dirty, increasingly unreliable, and it cannot compete on a level playing field with renewable energy resources.&#8221;</p>



<p>If coal is indeed &#8220;clean,&#8221; as Trump asserts, then why do his executive orders include an allowance for coal plant operators to forego reductions of mercury, arsenic and benzene, she added. In fact, the U.S. fleet of coal-fired power plants is aging, with many plants that are beyond 50 and 60 years old. Utilities continually cite aging coal plants as a significant factor in rising costs, Harbine said.</p>



<p>Trump&#8217;s approach, according to Harbine, lacks evidence of actual, proven health and economic benefits.</p>



<p>&#8220;At some point, communities are going to say, &#8216;No. We deserve clean air. We deserve clean water. We deserve a future that is brighter and that invests in the new technologies that are available to us,'&#8221; Harbine said.</p>
