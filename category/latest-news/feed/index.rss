Economist sees ‘disaster.’"></a></p>
<p>Gov. Mark Gordon said he sees &#8220;opportunity&#8221; for Wyoming in President Donald Trump&#8217;s tariff wars. At a press conference last week, he echoed the Wyoming congressional delegation&#8217;s praise for Trump&#8217;s economic policies as a tool to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and level the nation&#8217;s trade imbalance with much of the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Trump tariffs have kind of shuffled the deck, in a way, and I think it&#8217;s a great opportunity for Wyoming to be able to pick up the game,&#8221; Gordon told reporters while highlighting his April <a href="https://wyofile.com/governor-trade-mission-to-japan-taiwan-could-increase-wyoming-fossil-fuel-exports/">trade mission to Japan and Taiwan</a>. &#8220;Taiwan very much understood that they can buy more [U.S.] energy and that will help their situation in the trade deficit.&#8221;</p>



<p>But southwest Wyoming, the world&#8217;s largest exporter of natural soda ash, along with agricultural producers, businesses reliant on tourism and natural resource extractive industries across the state — as well as ordinary Equality State consumers of almost anything — have cause for concern, according to one Wyoming economist.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just no good way to spin the Trump administration&#8217;s economic policies in the short term,&#8221; University of Wyoming Associate Professor of Economics Rob Godby told WyoFile. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been disastrous, and they&#8217;re going to be disastrous.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" width="780" height="520" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oil-and-Gas-ops.jpg?resize=780%2C520&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-64714" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oil-and-Gas-ops.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oil-and-Gas-ops.jpg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oil-and-Gas-ops.jpg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oil-and-Gas-ops.jpg?resize=450%2C300&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oil-and-Gas-ops.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Oil-and-Gas-ops.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="(max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Oil and gas equipment associated with fracking at the Pinedale Anticline Field. (Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The global oil market dominates much of the world&#8217;s economy and plays an outsized role in the nation&#8217;s economic pulse, especially Wyoming&#8217;s, Godby noted. So far, the market&#8217;s reaction is pointing to economic decline. That&#8217;s bad for Wyoming&#8217;s economy across the board, he said, and portends lower revenues to the state&#8217;s coffers.</p>



<p>Godby also serves on the state&#8217;s Consensus Revenue Estimating Group, which consists of the state&#8217;s top bean-counters tasked with estimating revenues to fund state and local governments. While tourism and agriculture play vital roles in the state&#8217;s revenue picture, Godby and his fellow CREG members closely monitor coal, oil and natural gas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to providing more than $2.4 billion in state revenues in 2023, the oil and natural gas industry supported nearly 59,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/energy-environment/exxon-chevron-earnings.html">U.S. oil prices have declined since Jan. 20</a>, when Trump began his second term in the White House, slipping by about 20% to around $56 per barrel over the weekend.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would say that the biggest effect on our revenues is really the indirect effect that will be caused by world oil prices, which is really driving down [Wyoming] oil revenues, especially in the last month and a half,&#8221; Godby said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not quite seeing it yet in terms of reported numbers, but we know it&#8217;s going to hit us because these prices are well below what we expected.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CREG group is on the front lines of measuring Wyoming&#8217;s vulnerability in international trade and the overall U.S. economy, according to Gordon&#8217;s office. Gordon&#8217;s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile, &#8220;We&#8217;re monitoring the tariff situation closely, which is constantly changing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meantime, there are more acute concerns for Wyoming regarding Trump&#8217;s tariffs and potential retaliatory responses among U.S. trade partners, Godby said.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trona and soda ash</strong></h4>



<p>Trona mined in Wyoming is processed into “natural” soda ash — a key component in the production of glass, baking soda and myriad other products. Wyoming’s trona and soda ash industry employs more than 2,000 workers, compared to about 4,100 direct jobs in Wyoming coal mining, according to the Wyoming Mining Association.</p>



<p>By far, soda ash is the state&#8217;s biggest foreign export commodity in terms of sales. Of Wyoming&#8217;s $2 billion in total exports in 2024, soda ash accounted for about $1.3 billion, according to Godby. China, Trump&#8217;s primary target in his tariff wars, typically accounts for about 10% of those soda ash purchases.</p>

<p>If the industry were to lose that 10%, it would be a significant blow, Godby said. What&#8217;s worse is the possibility that tariff wars might give a price advantage to synthetic soda ash, which Wyoming does not produce, and put a drag on exports to other nations.</p>



<p>&#8220;That could be a really significant impact on our [soda ash] exports,&#8221; he said, adding that it might even dampen plans for major expansions of trona mining and soda ash refining operations in the region.</p>



<p>WE Soda’s <a href="https://projectwest.com/">Project West</a>, a multi-billion dollar trona solution-mine expansion project now under construction near Granger, will create 2,000 temporary construction jobs, more than 400 permanent jobs and boost annual production by 3 million metric tons, according to the company. Pacific Soda&#8217;s proposed Dry Creek Trona Mine Project south of Green River, which has also crossed several <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2016395/510">regulatory approval milestones</a>, would bring in another 2,000 construction jobs and create about 300 full-time jobs, according to the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This vital development [the Dry Creek Trona Mine] will create hundreds of good-paying jobs for hardworking Wyoming families while strengthening our domestic supply chain for essential minerals that keep costs lower at the store for everyday Americans,&#8221; Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a prepared statement last week.</p>

<p>While the state&#8217;s trona and soda ash producers have been very &#8220;bullish&#8221; regarding exports in recent years, global dynamics for the commodities could change drastically if Trump&#8217;s trade wars escalate, according to Godby. Though the industry is not among the top three major influencers regarding the state&#8217;s overall revenue picture, &#8220;it does affect southwest Wyoming,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Though the industry may struggle in terms of past expectations to increase exports, Gordon said he hopes Trump&#8217;s policies might actually result in bringing glass manufacturing, which relies on soda ash, back to the U.S. and for the first time in Wyoming.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a long shot, but we&#8217;re really talking about bringing in glass manufacturers,&#8221; Gordon said, noting that he and his team visited with <a href="https://www.corning.com/careers/tw/en/careers/Locations/Taiwan.html">glass manufacturer Corning</a> while in Taiwan. &#8220;We talked about the possibility of being able to locate manufacturing here — a longtime dream of people in Wyoming. It may be a little bit more of an opportunity now with the backdrop of those tariffs.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oh, Canada, and China</strong></h4>



<p>Wyoming&#8217;s other vulnerability in international tariff wars is its reliance on Canada, the state&#8217;s largest international trading partner. The nation to the north accounts for about 20% of the state&#8217;s exports and 55% of imports, according to Godby. That translates into significant exposure for multiple goods, including robust trade of agricultural, manufacturing and heavy machinery components that both nations rely on in their natural resource extractive industries.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> &#8220;If you really wanted to sandbag the U.S. economy, you couldn&#8217;t have done much of a better job.&#8221;</p><cite>Rob Godby, University of Wyoming</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>&#8220;That clearly is going to have supply chain effects in terms of impacts on consumers, or impacts on what we produce, given the products that we bring in from Canada,&#8221; Godby said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If [Trump] gets tough with Canada, they&#8217;ll get tough back,&#8221; he added, noting the recent election of Prime Minister Mark Carney, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/americas/canada-election-results-carney-poilievre-intl-hnk">promises to rebuke Trump&#8217;s policies</a>. &#8220;Even though they know it hurts, they&#8217;re willing to do that, and Wyoming would be a victim of that trade war.&#8221;</p>



<p>Combined, Canada and China account for nearly 65% of Wyoming&#8217;s imports, according to Godby. &#8220;Clearly, Wyoming could be impacted much more than the nation as a whole, if we get into a kind of a trade dispute with those two countries.&#8221;</p>



<p>Still, based on his recent <a href="https://wyofile.com/governor-trade-mission-to-japan-taiwan-could-increase-wyoming-fossil-fuel-exports/">trade mission to Japan and Taiwan</a>, Gordon said he believes the tariff and trade policy negotiations serve as motivation for those markets — as well as others — to balance their trade deficits with the United States. Though he heard concerns about Trump&#8217;s tariffs and retaliatory trade policies, he also heard assurances that Japan and Taiwan are interested in balancing their trade with the U.S. Ways to do that could include importing more Wyoming-produced coal, natural gas, uranium and soda ash, as well as <a href="https://wyofile.com/why-wyoming-bar-nunn-crowd-seeks-info-on-plan-to-build-portable-nuclear-microreactors/">nuclear microreactors</a> that might be manufactured here.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Prime Minister [of Japan, <a href="https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/actions/202504/24hyoukei.html">Shigeru Ishiba]</a> said, &#8216;Look, we were [at an 80% trade imbalance with the U.S.] in the 1980s and now we&#8217;re less than 20%. So, you know, we&#8217;re anxious to work with you to rebalance,'&#8221; Gordon said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That type of interest includes potential investments by both Japan and Taiwan to expand port capacities in the U.S. and on their shores to increase the flow of Wyoming coal and natural gas to those and other Asian nations, he added.</p>



<p>Though Wyoming might see some new deals to ship energy commodities to Asian markets, Godby said, it would be despite escalating tariffs. The state may even land new manufacturing here at home, but those are long-term outcomes that first have to be built on investor confidence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hope is not a strategy,&#8221; Godby said. Even if the Trump administration pumps the brakes on tariffs completely, he added, there&#8217;s already a certain level of damage done to U.S. trade relations — and a big part of that is the fact that nobody knows what the Trump administration will do next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;With just general uncertainty, you&#8217;re going to see [investments] go down, which is going to hurt our economy. There&#8217;s no way to win that,&#8221; Godby said. &#8220;If you really wanted to sandbag the U.S. economy, you couldn&#8217;t have done much of a better job.&#8221;</p>

<p>CODY—Joe Martinez and Phillip Scheel sat in the back row of the Cody Auditorium, apart from the action that unfolded Saturday as the Wyoming Republican Party elected new leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a beautiful spring morning, but the two Thermopolis men had driven over that morning to spend the day inside, watching the party conduct its business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martinez and Scheel watched the roll call. All 74 state central committee members — each county GOP’s chair, committeeman and committeewoman — were either present or represented by a proxy voter. Those members sat at the front of the room at tables designated by county.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two men listened to remarks by Republican elected officials praising the Trump administration, and emotional farewell speeches from party stalwarts preparing to leave the organization’s top posts. They watched as party treasurer Bob Ferguson presented outgoing Chairman Frank Eathorne with a deluxe lever-action rifle, engraved with his name on one side, the mantra “ride for the brand” on the other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They watched the party unanimously reelect Secretary Donna Rice, who ran unopposed. They watched an election snafu resulting from miscounted ballots, which was resolved with a revote for vice chair. Ferguson won that race over Ginger Bennett.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And they watched as the party voted to elect <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-gop-to-select-new-leadership/">Bryan Miller over Rebecca Bextel</a> to replace Eathorne as chairman. Both candidates align with the further-right block of the party that gained traction under Eathorne, so the election was seen as unlikely to impact policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Martinez and Scheel also watched as their Republican peers voted to sideline them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March, the Hot Springs County GOP elected Martinez and Scheel its chairman and state committeeman respectively. But the validity of the election was quickly called into question when a complaint was filed with the state party, alleging that ousted precinct committee members had a right to vote due to a party bylaw. Soon after, Martinez and Scheel’s victories were overturned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two men then <a href="https://wyofile.com/hot-springs-county-gop-sues-wyoming-republican-party-for-allegedly-interfering-in-local-elections/">filed a lawsuit</a>, alongside the county’s new vice chair and secretary, alleging the state party interfered in their local elections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martinez and Scheel both appeared Saturday to reiterate that point. When the meeting opened for public comment, Martinez stood up from his chair to speak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m here because on March 17, our county did elections and they did it by law. And I just believe that we as a body are to follow the law. And we should be the ones up there representing Hot Springs County, myself and Phillip Scheel as state committeeman,” Martinez said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The party considered allowing Martinez and Scheel to cast provisional ballots, but the proposal failed in a voice vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dispute represents the latest development in a years-long debate over the extent to which the state should govern political parties — private organizations that sometimes make decisions with public implications. Eathorne expressed optimism at Saturday’s meeting that the court would treat the Hot Springs County complaint as a First Amendment issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As this litigation goes forward, this case will be about the government&#8217;s authority or not, over a private organization,” Eathorne said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This can be an exciting outcome for all of us,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h4>



<p>In March, an attorney for the Wyoming Republican Party advised several county parties to disregard state statute and a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling when considering who should be allowed to vote in local party elections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, the attorney advised county Republicans to follow a contested party bylaw since the matter involves a private organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I understand some have alleged county officers who are no longer precinct persons may not vote in your upcoming elections,” attorney Brian Shuck <a href="https://wyofile.com/in-dispute-over-local-elections-wyoming-republican-party-attorney-says-law-court-ruling-dont-apply/">wrote in a letter</a>. “They argue that, if there is conflict between a GOP bylaw and a state statute, the statute controls. I disagree.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shuck’s advice was centered on the fact that the dispute involves a private organization, which was also at the heart of a 2021 case in Uinta County.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that case, the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled that the bylaw “violated clear and unambiguous language” of state law. But because the high court did not decide whether the state law violated the party’s constitutional right to freedom of association, Shuck told county parties the bylaw — and ultimately, the U.S. Constitution — supplants state statute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Hot Springs County instead stuck to the law and the high court’s decision when it held officer elections. But sometime after the meeting was adjourned, Cheryl Aguiar filed a complaint with the state party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aguiar, former chairman of the Hot Springs County GOP and now a state committeewoman, disputed the validity of the county party’s elections and asked that the “provisional ballots” be counted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Wyoming Republican Party’s Dispute Resolution Committee sided with Aguiar. A revote including the provisional ballots followed in Hot Springs County, resulting in a new chair, Brady Harvey, and a new state committeeman, Russell Lewis.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saturday’s meeting&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>It was Harvey and Lewis who cast votes in Saturday’s leadership election in Cody, but not before some pushback. During roll call, former Sweetwater County GOP Chairman Elizabeth Bingham raised a point of order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I move that the state central committee not accept the officers from Hot Springs County who were elected in the second, unauthorized election due to the improper use of provisional ballots and the lack of proper authority to conduct a revote,” Bingham said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the motion failed, Bingham made a second attempt by proposing an amendment to the rules of procedure for its officer elections. More specifically, the amendment would have allowed Martinez, Scheel and Aguiar to cast provisional ballots, which would have been set aside and kept private until the ongoing litigation is resolved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the amendment was drafted by Shuck, Bingham said she supported it as a placeholder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m not trying to be difficult. I promise, guys, I truly do believe we will not prevail in this lawsuit. I just want us to have that protection,” Bingham said. “It really is simple.”</p>



<p>Aguiar pushed back on having any provisional ballots after supporting their use at the local level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The fact that there is a lawsuit out there that will intimidate this body to circumvent our bylaws and my right to vote on a secret ballot is disgusting,” she said.&nbsp;</p>





<p>While the amendment didn’t fix the larger issue, Sublette County Chairman and former Speaker of the House Albert Sommers stood in favor of its adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The problem is that we are choosing to violate the state law. Any private organization, if they violate state law, runs up against the law,” Sommers said. “And so I&#8217;m going to stand in favor of this amendment and really against violating state law.”</p>



<p>Goshen County GOP Chairman Kirk Haas disagreed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re magnifying the issues that have developed in Hot Springs County,” Haas said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the amendment failed.&nbsp;</p>

But congressional budgeting could kill it."></a></p>
<p>As the Wyoming Legislature met in early February, a lawmaker from the state’s southwest corner announced to his fellow representatives that the Trump administration had thrown out the Bureau of Land Management’s controversial Rock Springs resource management plan, <a href="https://wyofile.com/biden-administration-finalizes-rock-springs-plan-without-further-changes/">completed just weeks before</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But word of its death, <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/02/06/trump-administration-shuts-down-controversial-biden-era-rock-springs-management-plan/">parroted by</a> some in the media, was premature. U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s <a href="https://www.doi.gov/document-library/secretary-order/so-3418-unleashing-american-energy">“Unleashing American Energy” order</a>, which triggered the erroneous reports, said that the <a href="https://wyofile.com/blms-final-rock-springs-plan-seeks-balance-of-resource-development-and-wildlife-protections/">final plan for 3.6 million acres</a> of the Red Desert and checkerboard region would be &#8220;reviewed and, as appropriate, revised.&#8221; Months later, the federal resource management plan remains in effect.</p>



<p>“It’s still active. It’s not frozen,” BLM-Wyoming spokesman Micky Fisher told WyoFile. “We are now just identifying possible options.”</p>



<p>What path BLM takes to satisfy Burgum’s order is being decided at the agency’s Washington headquarters, Fisher said. Amending the plan through the established National Environmental Policy Act review process is among the options, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-do-the-secretary-of-the-interiors-recent-orders-mean/id1395671263?i=1000698239250">policy experts have predicted.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Congress, however, could take away BLM’s ability to decide for itself. Wyoming’s lone U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman has <a href="https://wyofile.com/in-new-leadership-post-hageman-takes-fresh-aim-at-federal-land-grizzly-policies/">brought such bills</a>. Her staff did not respond to a request Monday seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Hageman-8.6.24-c.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">U.S. Rep.

<p>There has also been <a href="https://wyofile.com/gop-led-congress-could-toss-rock-springs-plan-in-2025-using-an-unprecedented-move/">talk of using the Congressional Review Act</a> to overturn the land-use plan, which was <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/02/01/2011-2201/notice-of-intent-to-prepare-a-resource-management-plan-for-the-rock-springs-field-office-wyoming-and">nearly 14 years in the making</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet another possible route for Congress to undo the plan, which <a href="https://wyofile.com/misinformation-hysteria-dominate-response-to-blms-plan-for-sw-wyoming/">caused a political furor</a> during its draft stages, is to address it during the ongoing budget reconciliation process. That remains on the table.</p>



<p>Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, included two provisions in his <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II00/20250506/118151/BILLS-119-CommitteePrint-W000821-Amdt-012.pdf">draft reconciliation bill</a> that address BLM resource management plans in Wyoming. One would not allow the BLM to “implement, administer or enforce” the RMP for its Rock Springs field office. The other includes the same prohibitionary language for BLM acting on its new plan for its Buffalo Field Office — which includes a coal-leasing ban in the Powder River Basin that’s now <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-montana-sue-feds-to-repeal-powder-river-basin-coal-leasing-ban/">being litigated</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/notice_--_full_committee_markup_of_committee_print_05.06.25.pdf">markup of the draft reconciliation bill is scheduled for 8:15 a.m.</a> MST on Tuesday. Ultimately, the provisions could lead to the Rock Springs and Buffalo plans being killed by only a simple majority vote — budget reconciliation isn’t subject to the filibuster, so only 51 votes are needed to get it through the U.S. Senate.</p>



<p>That’s a possibility that has conservation groups in Wyoming on guard. Congress — via budget reconciliation or otherwise — has never successfully thrown out a federal land-use plan, said Julia Stuble, Wyoming director for The Wilderness Society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We can&#8217;t find an example of this kind of congressional overreach … being successful,&#8221; Stuble said. “We’ve certainly seen some attempts at this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not a sure thing that the resource management plan provisions will carry forward. Provisions in budget reconciliation must have a direct effect on the federal budget, and it’s unclear if congressional rules would allow for RMP provisions.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lt.-MT-Elk-herd-sbb_14111.jpeg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A large elk herd kicks up a cloud of dust as it evacuates a hillside on Little Mountain, a peak east of Flaming Gorge Reservoir within the Bureau of Land Management’s Rock Springs Field Office. (Steven Brutger)</figcaption></figure>



<p>If congressional Republicans do carry the provisions forward successfully, it’d set a bad precedent in Stuble’s view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think anyone who believes that the small government closest to the people is the best form of government should be opposed to this kind of overreach from Congress,” she said. “Because land-use plans, like RMPs, are developed at a local level, with tons of input from elected officials, community members and stakeholders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not everyone in Wyoming is on that page. Rep. Cody Wylie, a Republican representative from Rock Springs who prematurely announced the RMP’s death during the legislative session, believes that local interests were cut out of the BLM’s process. That decision charted the future of millions of acres of public land surrounding his legislative district.</p>



<p>“The way it was written, it was completely biased — not even conservation, but preservation,” Wylie said. “That’s just not realistic for the state of Wyoming. Our economy has run off of the extraction industries.” </p>



<p>Efforts to strike more of a balance between <a href="https://wyofile.com/blms-final-rock-springs-plan-seeks-balance-of-resource-development-and-wildlife-protections/">conservation and industrial development in the final plan</a> didn’t alleviate his concerns.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Wylie prefers that Congress not throw the plan out entirely, so the BLM doesn’t have to start from scratch. An amendment to the 2024 plan, he said, would be ideal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Then they can [include] all that informational work that&#8217;s been done over the last 15 years,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if congressional Republicans successfully throw out the new plan and BLM has to revert to its 1997 RMP, he won&#8217;t protest.</p>



<p>“I think we can live with that until we redo the RMP process,” Wylie said.</p>

<p>The first police killing in the town of Thermopolis’ history started with an investigation into methamphetamine use by workers at a local McDonald’s.</p>



<p>It ended with a bloody, close-range shootout inside a trailer home after an officer shouldered his way inside without a warrant. The officer, Sgt. Michael Mascorro, suffered a gunshot wound that came harrowingly close to killing him. While bleeding profusely, Mascorro shot and killed McDonald’s employee Buck Laramore.</p>



<p>Though Laramore shot first, wounding Mascorro while the officer’s gun was still in his holster, his mother and widow sued the Thermopolis Police Department in the U.S. District Court of Wyoming this week. They allege Mascorro had no grounds to enter the trailer and that Laramore was defending himself against a police officer who was, in essence, a lawless intruder into his home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This was a completely avoidable incident,” Sweetwater County District Attorney Dan Erramouspe wrote at the time, <a href="https://www.thermopir.com/story/2023/10/12/news/mascorro-cleared-in-fatal-shooting-but-is-found-to-have-illegally-broke-into-home/13897.html">according to the Thermopolis Independent Record</a>. The prosecutor, who conducted a criminal review of the shooting and is not involved in the civil lawsuit, ruled Mascorro entered Laramore&#8217;s home illegally. Town officials later rejected that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their lawsuit, Laramore’s relatives cite self-defense laws like Wyoming’s controversial “stand your ground” statute and the castle doctrine, both of which generally allow homeowners to protect themselves with deadly force from an intruder. While Erramouspe found Mascorro had entered the home illegally, the prosecutor also found he was justified in shooting back at Laramore. The state’s castle doctrine carries an exception for when the intruder in one’s home is a police officer, and when the shooting started, Mascorro was defending himself, the prosecutor wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The family’s lawyers disagree. “It was Mascorro’s own reckless and deliberate conduct that unreasonably created his use of force,” they wrote in the complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither lawyers for the plaintiffs nor Thermopolis Police Chief Pat Cornwall responded to messages from WyoFile this week seeking comment on the case.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Investigation</h4>



<p>The violence on April 28, 2023 can be traced back to two days earlier, when a different Thermopolis police officer arrested a different McDonald’s employee who had an outstanding warrant. When the officer helped that employee out of her patrol car at the jail, she found a glass pipe on the car seat, according to a report on the shooting compiled by Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation agents. The employee had smoked meth from the pipe that morning with one of his McDonald’s colleagues, he told the officer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thermopolis police officers decided to contact the area health inspector, Jamie George, for a combined investigation into meth use among the McDonald’s employees. That investigation led Mascorro and a Hot Springs County sheriff’s deputy with a drug dog to the restaurant on April 28 — where Laramore had just started his work shift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mascorro found Laramore suspicious. He saw Laramore leave the men’s room, and soon afterward the drug dog detected meth hidden in containers in the bathroom’s baby changing station, according to the DCI investigation. The officer asked Laramore to take a drug test, which the McDonald’s worker declined to do. When Mascorro asked for his name, Laramore misspelled it by one letter. He also said his birth year was 1988, when it was in fact 1989.&nbsp;</p>

Michael Mascorro poses for a photograph posted to the Thermopolis Police Department website. (Thermopolis Police Department)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Laramore left the McDonald’s shortly after the exchange and returned home. When Mascorro learned Laramore had given him a misspelled name and the wrong birth year, he called a Hot Springs County prosecutor, according to an interview with the prosecutor conducted by the DCI investigators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kelly Owens, the prosecutor, told Mascorro they could not connect Laramore to the meth in the bathroom. The officer then said he wanted to arrest Laramore for interfering with the investigation by giving false information about himself. Owens suggested Mascorro could just write Laramore a ticket instead, according to the lawsuit. </p>



<p>But Mascorro wanted to arrest Laramore, he would later tell DCI agents. </p>



<p>A two-decade veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Mascorro had joined the Thermopolis Police Department eight years prior. At the time of the shooting, he was the agency’s second in command. The DCI agents who investigated Laramore’s death asked Mascorro why he went to Laramore’s home alone. The small police department was shorthanded, Mascorro told the investigators, and he did not have an option for backup. “It’s the nature of this job,” he said, according to the DCI report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During his tenure in Thermopolis, Mascorro had received four use-of-force complaints, according to the lawsuit. He was accused of kicking a man and knocking him to the ground while arresting him, and in another instance, of escalating an encounter into a fight at Thermopolis’s signature drinking establishment, the One-Eyed Buffalo. Just six days before the shootout, the Wyoming Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission had cleared Mascorro of any wrongdoing in those incidents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lawsuit claims the department should have corrected aggressive behavior by Mascorro, and that doing so may have prevented the fatal shootout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laramore’s McDonald’s colleagues described him to DCI agents as a “big-hearted” and good worker who sometimes felt down about life. When agents asked one colleague if Laramore was suicidal, she told them he would never kill himself because of his love for his wife.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the DCI report, however, Mascorro learned from his dispatcher on his way to Laramore’s home that the man also had a record of assault charges. Laramore was well armed — DCI agents would recover three pistols when they searched the home after the shooting. Agents also found meth, fentanyl and marijuana.</p>



<p>Mascorro arrived on Laramore’s doorstep several hours after their first encounter at the McDonald’s, according to the DCI investigation. He banged on the door, which Laramore came to but did not exit. A storm door separated the two men as they spoke. Mascorro told Laramore to come outside so he could be arrested for interference. Laramore said he would not do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The situation would go “one of two ways,” Mascorro suggested, according to the lawsuit. Either Laramore would step outside, or Mascorro would “break the door in.”</p>



<p>Laramore closed the door of his home. Mascorro opened the storm door and began to ram the main door with his shoulder.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shootout</strong> </h4>



<p>The Thermopolis Police Department released selective portions of Mascorro’s body camera footage from the incident, accompanying the footage with narration that gives the law enforcement view of the encounter. Mascorro entered the trailer because he believed Laramore could flee out the back door, the narration suggests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his interview with DCI, Mascorro said he considered Laramore’s closing of the door in his face the equivalent of fleeing arrest, and felt if he left to secure a warrant, Laramore would be gone when he returned.</p>



<p>In the lawsuit, the Laramore family’s attorneys argue Buck Laramore couldn’t have destroyed any evidence in the interference case because he had already given Mascorro the false information. There was no threat to the officer’s safety when the two men talked in the doorway, and Laramore’s refusal to step outside was not a crime, the complaint argued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laramore’s wife, Brandi, was also home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Mascorro broke through the door, he found Laramore standing in a hallway, pointing a Smith &amp; Wesson handgun at him with both hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mascorro’s gun was still in its holster, according to the DCI report. Laramore fired once and put a .45-caliber bullet through Mascorro’s right arm and into his chest, where it broke one of the officer’s ribs and passed through his lung, narrowly missing his spine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shot knocked Mascorro to the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laramore advanced toward him, and according to the DCI report, likely fired another shot, though it didn’t strike Mascorro and it’s unclear where the round went.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lying on the ground, Mascorro called on Laramore to “stop, stop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, Laramore did not fire another shot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mascorro told the DCI agents he did not know why Laramore did not shoot him again, in the head, while he lay on the ground. But Mascorro pulled his pistol and began firing, shooting seven times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brandi Laramore hid in the home’s bathroom. According to the DCI report, she took the family dog into the bathroom with her. But in a frame from the body camera footage, the dog runs across the trailer floor as Mascorro, now standing, aims his gun toward Laramore.</p>

<p>It’s unclear if Mascorro hit Laramore during his first fusillade. Laramore appears to have retreated into another room of the trailer. According to the lawsuit, Laramore then stepped into Mascorro’s line of sight, now unarmed, and the officer fired three times. According to Mascorro’s interview with DCI agents, the officer believed Laramore was tactically peering around the corner and was still trying to shoot and kill him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mascorro hit Laramore with his first shot, he believed, and possibly his second.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time it was Laramore who fell to the ground and yelled, “stop, stop,” according to the lawsuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mascorro, now severely weakened by his injuries, collapsed to the floor. He was able to stagger out of the home before collapsing again in the yard, where arriving officers found him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inside the trailer, Laramore died in his wife’s arms, she told DCI agents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Medics airlifted Mascorro to a hospital in Casper, where the officer came in and out of consciousness. When Mascorro returned to Thermopolis, he did so as a hero, welcomed with a parade, according to the Cowboy State Daily. However, after Erramouspe cleared Mascorro of any homicide charges but found he should not have entered Laramore’s home, the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission again investigated the officer and considered decertifying him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decertifying an officer is the review board’s strongest and rarely used sanction — it would have prevented Mascorro from working in law enforcement anywhere in Wyoming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>POST, led at the time by former Casper police chief Chris Walsh, chose not to take that step. After a review of Erramouspe’s findings, the DCI report, state law and department policy, town officials in June 2024 decided Mascorro would return to duty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Town believes Sgt. Mascaro did not violate policy or the law,” Thermopolis Mayor Adam Estenson said in a statement announcing the officer’s return.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I look forward to continued conversation on what policing looks like for Thermopolis into the future,” he continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the shootout was the town’s first police killing, according to an October 2023 statement from Estenson, a second would soon follow. In September 2024, a different Thermopolis police officer conducting a wellness check would run into a mentally ill man, Jared Gottula, who was swinging a bat wildly in his yard. Gottula advanced on the officer’s patrol vehicle and the officer struck him with it. During the tense encounter that followed, the officer and a Hot Springs County sheriff’s deputy fired more than 20 rounds, killing Gottula.</p>



<p>A review found the officers began shooting after Gottula advanced on the deputy with the bat raised. Both officers were cleared of any wrongdoing, and to date, no lawsuit has been filed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grassy Wyoming roadsides can be enticing to grizzly bears, especially mothers with cubs, and many people can’t resist stopping to marvel at the charismatic critters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everybody wants to see a bear. That’s the picture you want to take home from your vacation,” said Wyoming Highway Patrol Sgt. Andy Jackson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stopping to view wildlife can be done safely, but in the heat of the moment, the trooper has written tickets to motorists for stopping in the middle of the road, leaving their car doors flung open and standing a hundred yards down the highway to take pictures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I ask them, ‘Would you do this where you live?’ And they go, ‘Well, no,’” Jackson said. “And I go, ‘Well why would you do it here?’”</p>



<p>As bears come out of hibernation, the snow melts and grass greens up along roadsides, Jackson and his colleagues with other local, state and federal agencies are gearing up to attempt to steer humans toward safer habits when it comes to viewing wildlife.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Togwotee Pass tees up a particularly vexing mix of grizzlies, wildlife watchers, steep grades, blind corners, high speeds and troubling behavior. Local, state and federal agencies put out a joint call last week for people to follow “ethical wildlife viewing and photography practices” on Togwotee Pass. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department and U.S. Forest Service have jointly stepped up patrols and are asking the public to heed their directions to minimize traffic jams and ensure safety for humans and bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent Steve Stoinski knows what a hazardous —&nbsp;and sometimes volatile — mix can be found on Togwotee Pass after <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/bye-felicia-hazing-isn-t-popular-or-pretty-but-it-s-keeping-celebrity-grizzly-away/article_17aaec9b-158f-581a-9c68-719053cc3057.html">spending the summer</a> of 2021 trying to solve the problem. Stoinski came out of retirement to work, under contract, for the Fish and Wildlife Service to intensively haze Grizzly 863, also known as Felicia, away from the roadside. Stoinski was already familiar with the grizzlies of Togwotee Pass, having previously investigated reports of drones harassing the federally protected threatened species. Although hazing briefly deterred the mother grizzly, Stoinski saw that it didn’t have a lasting effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The takeaways I had for managing grizzlies near the road,” he told WyoFile, “the bears are just going to hang out on the road.”</p>



<p><strong>Roadside bears</strong></p>



<p>Grizzlies have reasons to be <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/grizzly-399s-death-prompts-study-of-roadside-bear-watching/article_9cb48e1c-b1e8-11ef-921c-6b50d06ebc3c.html">next to the road</a>, whether to forage for food or for their own safety, he said. Male grizzlies tend to stay away from the highway, and female grizzlies tend to avoid male grizzlies to protect their cubs, he said. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/NadplQvQ/img_0688-2.mov"></video></figure>



<p>“I only saw one boar griz that whole summer,” Stoinski recalled. “At that time, Felicia, Bear 863, she headed out of that area as soon as she got wind of that bear and bolted across the highway. We had to stop traffic to get her across the highway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wildlife managers no longer have Bear 863 marked, according to Game and Fish Large Carnivore Supervisor Dan Thompson. Out of an abundance of caution, Thompson didn’t want to say for certain whether the sow and two cubs frequenting the Togwotee Pass area this spring are Felicia and her offspring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over the years, we’ve started to wonder if 863 has turned into a different bear that just likes the road,” Thompson told WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, there’s a sow with two cubs that frequents the area. Game and Fish caught and marked one of the cubs last summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We definitely have a bear that is very observable, and it’s unfortunate we have to go back every year and remind everybody [of] etiquette and ethics when it comes to viewing them,” Thompson said.&nbsp;</p>

Never approach bears. People should maintain a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife. (Jason Wilmot/U.S. Forest Service)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Ethical, and legal, viewing practices include not approaching bears, maintaining 100 yards between yourself and a bear, stopping in paved pullouts — not on the shoulder — and not feeding wildlife. Though Wyoming Highway Patrol typically responds to traffic complaints, they also get called to Togwotee Pass for confrontations over bear viewing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At times, some of the Game and Fish, some of the biologists, get harassed by the people that are bear watching,” Trooper Jackson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already this spring, Thompson said, “we’ve had some pretty nasty confrontations from some members of the public, basically telling us we can’t tell them what to do.”</p>



<p><strong>Human nature&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Those tensions motivated multiple agencies to come together to ask the public to follow directions from law enforcement and wildlife managers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stoinski also got an earful from bear watchers and photographers in 2021 when he hazed bears away from the road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They were pretty belligerent,” Stoinski <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/bye-felicia-hazing-isn-t-popular-or-pretty-but-it-s-keeping-celebrity-grizzly-away/article_17aaec9b-158f-581a-9c68-719053cc3057.html">said at the time</a>. “They got in our faces, were poking me in the chest.”</p>



<p>But eventually, they overcame those initial conflicts and worked together to promote bear and human safety, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bridger-Teton National Forest is leaning heavily into <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/r04/bridger-teton/newsroom/releases/agencies-call-upon-public-help-keep-bears-wild-and-people-safe">education and cooperation</a> to improve safety for bears and people on the highway, which is a <a href="https://dot.state.wy.us/files/live/sites/wydot/files/shared/Planning/Centennial%20Scenic%20Byway.pdf">designated scenic byway</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the <a href="https://bearwisejh.org/">Bear Wise Jackson Hole program</a> and other agency partners, the national forest is asking “the public, photographers, and wildlife tour groups to lead by example.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We get that there’s a lot of opportunities to see wildlife all over the forest,” Bridger-Teton spokeswoman Mary Cernicek said. As new vegetation sprouts along roadsides, attracting bears, “we’re so excited to see them and probably having unintended consequences.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="534" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?resize=780%2C534&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-75808" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?resize=768%2C526&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?resize=400%2C274&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?resize=706%2C484&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners have used this photograph over the years to illustrate the dangerous mix of bears, people and traffic on Togwotee Pass. (Bridger-Teton National Forest)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Originally, Togwotee didn’t see a heavy management presence along the highway, but as bear jams escalated, wildlife managers responded with attempts to change both bear and human behavior. Game and Fish still hazes grizzlies, when possible, away from the Togwotee highway.</p>



<p>“It’s been an ongoing effort to try to keep something worse from happening,” Thompson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it is Felicia along the road, she has been <a href="https://buckrail.com/explainer-what-to-do-in-the-event-of-a-wildlife-vehicle-collision-2/">hit by a car</a> before, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last fall, world-famous Grizzly 399 was <a href="https://wyofile.com/authorities-driver-hit-grizzly-399-while-going-speed-limit-killing-famous-bear-almost-instantly/">fatally struck</a> by a vehicle on the highway through the Snake River Canyon south of Jackson. The <a href="https://wyofile.com/grizzly-bear-399-struck-killed-by-vehicle-south-of-jackson/">matriarch bruin</a> had raised her cubs roadside in Grand Teton National Park for nearly two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Visitors save up and come from around the world to see Wyoming wildlife — a phenomenon not limited to national parks.</p>



<p><strong>Striking a balance&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In Wyoming, it’s illegal to park on the shoulder of a highway unless it’s an emergency, Trooper Jackson said, and people are supposed to use designated pullouts. But enforcing that law isn’t so easy.</p>



<p>He points to the hamlet of Wilson at the base of Teton Pass, where a moose can be seen most summer days from the shoulder of Highway 22.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All summer long, we get people stopping, taking a picture of the moose in Fish Creek,” Jackson said. Wyoming Highway Patrol fields frequent complaints from people who want the cars out of there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And I’m going, ‘These people came 2,000 miles to see this,’” Jackson said. “We try to have a good balance of what’s common sense.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Teton County Sheriff’s Office also enforces traffic laws and gets called to help out on Togwotee Pass. Sheriff Matt Carr said the county used to offer overtime pay to a deputy who lived in nearby Buffalo Valley to patrol the area more frequently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The key problem is people stopping,” Carr said. “It’s really not the tourists as much as it is the professional photographers.”</p>



<p>Carr said he no longer has that deputy or the budget to help as much as the county has in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re trying to watch budgets very seriously this year with the revenue losses we’re seeing from <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/town_county/facing-6-million-deficit-state-cuts-teton-county-mulls-increasing-property-taxes/article_244684e8-eec0-440d-9cc8-ffcffddb302d.html">property tax reductions</a>,” Carr said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Grizzly speed limit?</strong></p>



<p>Looking back on his summer managing the mayhem in 2021, Stoinski sees human nature as a major driver of behavior that can’t be overlooked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People coming from across the country to visit the parks, or to visit Wyoming, and they see a grizzly bear for the first time in their lives, they just can&#8217;t help but stop,” Stoinski said. “There&#8217;s got to be a balance between letting people enjoy the bears while they&#8217;re near the road without getting too close.”</p>



<p>One thing that authorities can control is the speed limit. For his part, Stoinski would like to see variable speed limits deployed when grizzlies are in the area and bear jams become unavoidable.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit.&#8221;</p><cite>Steve Stoinski, retired USFWS Special agent </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Wyoming has variable speed limits for blizzards along the interstate, he noted. Why not take the concept for a test drive along Togwotee?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit, you know when the bears are around the highway,” he said. “Slow traffic down just for people’s safety.”</p>



<p>Already, electronic signs posted along the highway tell people not to stop on the road to view bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p><a href="https://jhwildlife.org/">Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation</a> Executive Director Renee Seidler encourages wildlife enthusiasts to find safer spots to view bears.</p>



<p>“The biggest issue is the road, the traffic, the speed and very little capacity to manage the crowds,” Seidler said, compared to nearby wildlife viewing hot spots in Teton Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seidler also said the agencies might not have yet found the right mix of “carrot and stick.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a recurring problem that I would love to see fixed,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CODY—Two days of discussion about the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population passed before anyone inquired about the status of the species the meeting was focused on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under <a href="https://wyofile.com/judge-gives-feds-45-days-to-decide-on-yellowstone-grizzly-bears-threatened-status/">a court order</a> in January, the Biden administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="https://wyofile.com/feds-yellowstone-lower-48-grizzlies-to-remain-protected-by-endangered-species-act/">proposed continuing with Endangered Species Act protections</a> in the Yellowstone region and all other portions of the Lower 48 where grizzlies reside. Shortly thereafter, pro-delisting leadership was installed by the Trump administration: <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/trumps-interior-pick-backs-grizzly-delisting/article_c3196be2-d45f-11ef-9f85-0bd6e149c5bf.html">Interior Secretary Doug Burgum</a> and Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director who’s now <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-taps-former-wyoming-game-and-fish-chief-nesvik-to-lead-u-s-fish-and-wildlife-service/">nominated</a> to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For months, there’s been little official word about what’s going on with Fish and Wildlife’s proposal, though the agency <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-administration-delays-deadline-for-feedback-on-federal-protection-for-grizzlies/">delayed the deadline</a> for the public to provide feedback. In Cody this week, the topic was barely broached at the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s semi-annual Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee meeting. It only came up because a member of the public, local resident Dewey Vanderhoff, asked “where we’re at in the overall picture with delisting” during the meeting’s closing minutes.</p>

<p>Hilary Cooley, Fish and Wildlife&#8217;s grizzly bear recovery coordinator, pointed out the proposal on the table — and said she couldn’t say much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As far as what happens with that proposal, we’re waiting for leadership to be installed,” Cooley said. “Acting leadership is not interested in making decisions right now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of Friday, 27 pending nominees appeared above Nesvik on the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nom_cal_civ.htm">U.S. Senate’s Executive Calendar</a>, which suggests the wait could drag on. The Trump administration also <a href="https://wyofile.com/muley-fanatics-founder-josh-coursey-tapped-by-trump-for-high-fish-and-wildlife-service-post/">appointed another Wyomingite — mule deer advocate Josh Coursey</a> — to a high Fish and Wildlife Service post, albeit one that doesn’t require Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if expected Fish and Wildlife Service leaders don’t attempt to pull back the existing continued-listing proposal administratively, legislative efforts are underway to delist grizzly bears, <a href="https://wyofile.com/in-new-leadership-post-hageman-takes-fresh-aim-at-federal-land-grizzly-policies/">including from Rep. Harriet Hageman</a>.</p>





<p>The gathering of Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear managers in Cody differed from typical meetings because of the turmoil and turnover the Trump administration has brought to the federal government via its Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Most federal members of the committee attended remotely due to travel and spending restrictions. There were also new faces, goodbyes and discussion about what the <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-and-musks-doge-functionally-destroying-historic-yellowstone-grizzly-science-team/">diminished Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team</a> can realistically accomplish going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One way or another, the USGS is not going to have the resources they&#8217;ve had in the past,” Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Administrator Ken McDonald told the group. “At the November meeting, we better have a plan for the following spring.”</p>



<p>Biologist Matt Gould, the study team’s new leader, told the group that, despite changes in capacity, the committee’s science arm will continue with grizzly monitoring, data collection and <a href="https://wyofile.com/the-new-way-biologists-count-yellowstone-region-grizzly-bears-explained/">administering the new population model</a> to assess bear numbers — last estimated at 1,050 in the ecosystem’s core.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Cody meeting was the last as a full-time employee for <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-and-musks-doge-functionally-destroying-historic-yellowstone-grizzly-science-team/">Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team</a> Leader Frank van Manen. The longtime federal biologist <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-and-musks-doge-functionally-destroying-historic-yellowstone-grizzly-science-team/">retired earlier than expected</a>, though he is staying involved in an emeritus role. He helmed the group for 13 years.</p>



<p>“I know there are some challenges ahead, but keep up the good fight,” van Manen told the group. “This endeavor has been successful for 50 years, for a good reason: Agencies working together.”</p>

<p>LARAMIE—A March <a href="https://wyofile.com/appeals-court-backs-corner-crossers-in-wyoming-public-lands-case/">ruling</a> by a federal appeals court in a widely watched corner-crossing case determined that private landowners cannot bar access to public lands with fences, trespass actions or other methods.</p>



<p>Hunters, recreators and public lands advocates celebrated the ruling and its implications for the states within the 10th Circuit — Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Oklahoma and Kansas.</p>



<p>Thursday, however, Ryan Semerad, the attorney who represented the <a href="https://wyofile.com/corner-crossing/">four Missouri hunters in the </a>federal civil lawsuit, urged recreators to exercise caution and goodwill if attempting to corner cross — or step from one piece of public land to another where those two parcels meet at a common corner with two private parcels, in a checkboard pattern of ownership. Wyoming’s checkerboard spans more than 2 million acres.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are limitations to that decision,” Semerad said Thursday during a corner-crossing panel discussion in Laramie. “That doesn&#8217;t mean go jump on your side by side … and just have at it. It doesn&#8217;t mean you get to go on private property without permission, consent or something else. What it means is that you have reasonable access to step from one section to the next section, so long as you can be situated appropriately, you know where the monument marker is, you know where you&#8217;re going and you respect that.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="622" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?resize=780%2C622&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-89490" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?resize=1024%2C817&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?resize=768%2C612&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?resize=400%2C319&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop-1024x817.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The first corner the hunters crossed was marked by T-posts chained together, signs and a survey monument. (Wyoming Backcountry Hunters and Anglers)</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are also outstanding questions for landowners, said Wyoming Stock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna, another panelist. His group filed an amicus brief in the case in support of the landowner who sued the Missouri hunters for stepping over, but never touching, Elk Mountain Ranch property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s pretty clear that you cannot deny access to these checkerboard lands,” Magagna said. “Does that mean that you have to allow crossing at every corner? If I want to identify one of the four corners that I control as the access point, do I have the liberty to do that? Or if I want to designate a path through the middle of my private land in lieu of granting access across the corners?</p>



<p>“Those are many of the questions that still remain out there to be addressed,” Magagna said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As they talked, it became clear that interpretations of the ruling still vary widely. But both urged common sense and respectful communication —&nbsp;traditional tenets of Wyoming hunting etiquette regarding private landowners.</p>



<p>“We need to remember that it&#8217;s a culture of cooperation with these lands, and that&#8217;s how this is going to work moving forward,” Semerad said.</p>



<p>The panel was part of the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation Summit, a two-day event bringing together outdoor recreation business leaders, public lands agency officials, nonprofits and others to strengthen the burgeoning industry and enhance access to resources. The summit is one product of newly expanded state government support of the outdoor recreation —&nbsp;Wyoming’s Office of Outdoor Recreation helps put it on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Appropriately, the panel addressed a legal question that has captivated recreators in Wyoming and the nation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hunters, a wealthy landowner, trespass charges</strong> </h4>



<p>In 2020, hunters Brad Cape, John Slowensky and Phillip Yeomans corner crossed to hunt on Elk Mountain, then did so again with Zach Smith in 2021.</p>



<p>Carbon County ranch owner Fred Eshelman sued the four men in 2022 for passing through the airspace above his property on their way to hunt.</p>



<p>Eshelman sued to block them, and anyone else, from corner crossing to reach some 11,000 acres of federal and state land enmeshed in his 50-square-mile ranch, a coveted hunting ground known for its abundant wildlife.</p>

(IU.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)</figcaption></figure>



<p>That set off a series of court challenges and appeals in a case that involved everything from the limits of private property rights to the extent of airspace and the legality of preventing the public from accessing public land.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With implications not only for the 2.4 million acres of “corner-locked” land in Wyoming, but also for 8.3 million acres across the West, the case gained national attention, particularly among hunters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It culminated in March with the appeals court decision. In a unanimous opinion, the three-judge panel sided against Eshelman, citing an act of Congress that preempts Wyoming trespass law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congress enacted the Unlawful Inclosures Act in 1885. “No one may completely prevent or obstruct another from peacefully entering or freely passing over or through public lands,” the act says, according to the appellate judges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The act, which explicitly prohibits “obstructing transit over public lands by force, threats, intimidation, or by any fencing or inclosing,” supersedes Wyoming trespass law, the judges ruled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that means in practical terms, Semerad said Thursday, is this: “You can now step from one section of public land to the next. In Wyoming, there is no state law, statute or regulation that can stop you; the federal law would preempt it.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Questions remain </strong></h4>



<p>Magagna believes the ruling is aimed explicitly at the checkerboard — not islands of public land surrounded by private land elsewhere, he said Thursday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Semerad disagreed. “The Unlawful Inclosures Act applies to all public lands,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderator Dan McCoy, director of the Jay Kemmerer WORTH Institute, asked if the Wyoming Legislature or the state could have a bearing on the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee will discuss corner crossing when it holds an interim meeting June 5-6 in Dubois.&nbsp;</p>

(Steven Brutger)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though the ruling clearly states the Unlawful Inclosures Act is supreme, Magagna said, “I think where there is opportunity, potentially for the Legislature should they choose to do so, is to better define the tools that are available and the limitations on the use of those tools.” He also brought up land exchanges by which more public land could become accessible without the necessity of corner crossing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what should recreators do if they come across a corner that’s fenced off, McCoy asked.</p>



<p>“If you come across a fenced corner, call me, call the U.S. Attorney’s office because that&#8217;s unlawful,” Semerad said. “That is straight up a violation of the Unlawful Inclosures Act.”</p>



<p>The March decision might not be the final word in the corner-crossing case. There is a chance it will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, Semerad said. The earliest the high court could see it is next winter, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, both men stressed a spirit of collaboration when it comes to public land users and private property owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Respect and cooperation is always going to take us much further than if we&#8217;re just going to be battling it out all the time,” Semerad said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real answer to all this, to me and I think to many people I represent,” Magagna added, “is the relationships we build in Wyoming with people, between private landowners and the recreation and outdoor community, particularly the sportsmen, hunters and fishermen. So I think that the key thing, for now at least, is to build those relationships.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Wyoming Refinery in Newcastle has resumed operations months after an apparent explosion in February forced the facility to remain idle for repairs.</p>



<p>The refinery shut down following the Feb. 12 incident, which refinery owner Par Pacific of Houston called an &#8220;operational upset.&#8221; The company would not provide details of what happened beyond &#8220;the main crude heater needed to be replaced&#8221; and that there was an &#8220;unexpected and unavoidable equipment malfunction,&#8221; according to WyoFile interviews and company communications with state officials.</p>



<p>Weston County Emergency Management posted on Facebook the night of the incident that &#8220;a heater blew up&#8221; at the refinery.</p>



<p>No injuries were reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some fuel production resumed on April 21, it will be some time before the refinery is back to full capacity of 20,000 barrels a day, Dallas Scholes, Par Pacific&#8217;s government and public affairs director, told WyoFile.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you bring one of these facilities back online, you&#8217;ve got to take it slow,&#8221; Scholes said. Because the equipment has been idle for months, making sure everything is running correctly and safely takes time, from bringing the heat up to making sure the oil can move through. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot that is involved, and our No. 1 priority in this whole process is to make sure it&#8217;s safe, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re focused on.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company is not projecting when the refinery will resume full operational capacity, but it is providing updates on a <a href="https://newcastleheaterresponse.com/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJ_U9FleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETE0ZmpBUTBSVTV3cnNwMEZkAR7yxR0gJ0jAfQ9Qbgue5v8-cj5PwSELf4K74Uuupp_oo97D9-Am_HAhMF_xfA_aem_gAmVzz98t61FnE1o_e67Mg">website</a> dedicated to the incident.</p>



<p>Even with fuel production shut down, the refinery&#8217;s workforce has been hard at work, according to Scholes.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are some really incredibly hard-working people, and they were doing a lot of extra shifts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We used everybody we could on site, and we brought in a lot of really good experts to fill in the gaps and to make things work. They were gainfully employed the whole time. I&#8217;m really proud of what they were able to step up and do.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The facility produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and propane from Powder River Basin crude, according to the company. The economic impact on the region motivated Par Pacific to get the refinery back in operation as soon as possible, Scholes said.&nbsp;</p>

(Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;We stored a lot [of unrefined crude], but that is one of the reasons why we wanted to work as fast as we could — so that we can make sure that oil is still flowing and still available, and to make sure that our producers are still gainfully employed at the end of the day as well.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The ‘explosion’</strong></h4>



<p>The company doesn&#8217;t use the term &#8220;explosion&#8221; in public-facing communications, and instead refers to the incident as an &#8220;operational upset.&#8221; However, in a <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wyo-Refining-Co-letter-to-DEQ-March.pdf">March 24 letter</a> to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Health, Safety, Security &amp; Environment Manager Michael Baldwin wrote, &#8220;During the evening of Feb. 12, [the refinery] experienced an explosion in their crude heater … which resulted in a total shutdown of the refinery.&#8221;</p>



<p>The incident did not result in any liquid spills or significant airborne gaseous or powder emissions, according to the company. &#8220;There were no emissions that left our fence line,&#8221; Scholes said.</p>



<p>Regulatory officials are still in the process of investigating the incident in coordination with Par Pacific.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Things can go wrong, and we live every day doing everything we can to make sure that they don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><cite>Dallas Scholes, Par Pacific</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The cause of the incident remains unclear. The company has refused to elaborate. &#8220;That [information] has not been passed on to me,&#8221; Scholes told WyoFile.</p>



<p>In a written communication to DEQ, the company refers to an &#8220;unexpected and unavoidable equipment malfunction&#8221; that occurred at about 10:37 p.m. on Feb. 12.</p>



<p>Weston County Emergency Management Coordinator Gilbert Nelson, who has been briefed by the company multiple times since the incident, told WyoFile, &#8220;They were just trying to restart the heater and it went boom.&#8221;</p>



<p>Par Pacific is studying what happened to cause the heater failure, Scholes said. &#8220;Anytime an incident occurs, we&#8217;re all hands on deck to come do an investigation to look for lessons learned that we can apply to any of our other facilities.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oil and gas refineries can be a dangerous profession,&#8221; Scholes added. &#8220;Things can go wrong, and we live every day doing everything we can to make sure that they don&#8217;t. And we were just incredibly lucky, and we developed new systems. We do new checks. This is not something anybody wants to see repeated, so you can bet that we will do everything we can to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the days following, the company&#8217;s public updates noted a lingering cold snap and notified locals that they would likely see more steam than usual as crews used boilers to try to keep equipment from freezing. &#8220;It was 20 below zero when all this was going on,&#8221; Scholes told WyoFile.</p>



<p>The company also notified residents there would be more flaring than usual. Refineries frequently burn residual petrol vapors to reduce their hazardous effects, resulting in a flame at the top of a stack. Later, the refinery asked the state for permission, which was granted, to use a temporary boiler to prevent equipment from freezing, state documents show.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>History of incidents</strong></h4>



<p>The refinery is situated just south of West Main Street and a half-mile from Newcastle High School. The refinery was established in 1927, and officials are quick to point out that it was the <a href="https://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/newcastle-wyoming?utm_source=chatgpt.com">town</a> — at the edge of the Black Hills with a population of about 3,300 — that grew around it.</p>



<p>Par Pacific, which also operates refineries in Hawaii, Billings, Montana and Tacoma, Washington, acquired the facility in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under a previous owner in the 2000s, Denver-based Hermes Consolidated, Inc., the refinery was known for <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyo-refineries/">a series of mishaps</a>, including a March 2002 spill that rained 20 tons of silica catalyst over a portion of the town, resulting in a 2008 settlement with 47 Newcastle-area residents. Details of the settlement were not disclosed. In the latter part of that decade, the refinery received nine “notices of violation” from Wyoming DEQ, resulting in $427,400 in civil penalties.</p>



<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also took action against the refinery at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company paid a civil penalty of $150,000 in 2009 and agreed to invest $14 million in upgrades to settle several alleged emission violations cited by the EPA. In 2010, Wyoming Refining paid a $157,500 penalty to the EPA for “failure to prepare, submit, and implement an adequate and complete Facility Response Plan.”</p>





<p>Scholes said Par Pacific prioritizes safety and environmental compliance. &#8220;We have certain standards at Par that may not have been there before, and we are constantly working to improve operations.&#8221;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DEQ-2023-inspect-report-Wyo-Refinery.pdf">2023 Wyoming DEQ inspection report</a>, the most recent available, determined, &#8220;There were no noted concerns during these inspections.&#8221; The inspection report also listed the refinery as being in &#8220;substantial compliance.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The safety of our workers and the community is our No. 1 priority,&#8221; Scholes said. &#8220;We&#8217;re very proud of our employees that live in the Newcastle community, and they stepped up. They did great work in bringing this facility back to where it can eventually get fully online.&#8221;<br><br>From 2017 to 2022, Wyoming&#8217;s overall oil refining capacity shrank by 27% — from 177,500 barrels per day to 125,850, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/PET_PNP_CAP1_DCU_SWY_A.htm">according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration</a>. The state went from five oil refineries to four in 2021 when HollyFrontier Sinclair converted its Cheyenne oil refinery to produce “renewable diesel,” which uses agricultural products — not oil — to produce the fuel.</p>

<p>Republicans from across the state will gather Saturday in Cody to elect the next chair of the Wyoming Republican Party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They’ll have at least two candidates to choose from — Rebecca Bextel of Jackson and Bryan Miller of Sheridan — to lead the party after Chairman Frank Eathorne announced he would not seek reelection.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyo-gop-chairman-quietly-assumed-power-as-party-fractured/">party members split</a> on Eathorne’s leadership style, he had enough support to chair the party through three terms. His tenure coincided with the further-right wing’s command of the state GOP and the rise of the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, as cemented by its <a href="https://wyofile.com/freedom-caucus-wins-control-of-wyoming-house/">2024 election victories</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bextel and Miller both align with that block of the party, so the choice between them is not a question of whether the top post will remain a dark shade of red. Both candidates, however, told WyoFile they have different things to offer the party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ve got a ton of experience with the [GOP] State Central Committee. I&#8217;ve got a ton of experience at the local Sheridan County Central Committee,” Miller said, pointing to over a decade of involvement with the Republican Party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have established relationships all across the state with a whole lot of people, and that, in itself, is a big deal,” he said.</p>



<p>While newer to the party, Bextel has recently demonstrated impressive fundraising chops and earned the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/harriethageman/posts/i-am-proud-to-support-my-friend-rebecca-for-wygop-chair-she-is-a-true-patriot-an/1335902584519510/">endorsement</a> of Wyoming’s U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Brian has been around a long time. But I think that&#8217;s the selling point for me,” Bextel said. “If I&#8217;m elected, this is about to be taken to a new level.”</p>



<p>A third or more moderate candidate has not publicly announced a bid for chair, but that remains a possibility since nominations can be made during Saturday’s meeting.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Rebecca Bextel</strong></h4>



<p>Bextel moved to Jackson about 20 years ago with her husband, Jonathan, and has made her living in real estate and as a registered agent. In September, she announced she would run for GOP chair, roughly seven months ahead of the election.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I decided to run early because it&#8217;s a big state, and I wanted to give people plenty of time to look me up or get to know me,” Bextel said, adding that in just the last three weeks she’s driven 9,000 miles and visited almost all 23 counties.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I decided to run because I felt like the role of the chairman of the party is to fundraise, grow the party, and direct the party at the will of the body,” she said. “And so this is not going to be the party of Rebecca Bextel. This is going to be the party of the grassroots. It&#8217;s going to be a bottom-up approach.”&nbsp;</p>

(Courtesy)</figcaption></figure>



<p>She&#8217;s raised $130,000 for the party since April, she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;ve also raised about $300,000 for conservative candidates and PACs. And a lot of those candidates helped push the [Wyoming] House further to the right,” she said. “I&#8217;m very proud of that.”</p>



<p>Bextel was herself a fixture of the Wyoming Capitol during the 2025 session, testifying on bills and spending time with lawmakers. That’s something she said she would continue to do as chair.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have a great relationship with a lot of the members of the House. I have a great relationship with some members of the Senate,” Bextel said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And while Miller may have experience, Bextel said, he lacks her “energy level” and “enthusiasm.” Plus, Bextel said she has some new ideas, like creating a group within the party to decide the conservative bona fides of Republican candidates.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I am actually considering making a new committee that will obviously be an odd number of people from the four corners of the state, across the Republican spectrum, and that committee will figure out who is 80% platform candidates and who is not,” Bextel said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Wyoming Republican Party’s <a href="https://www.wyoming.gop/post/wygop-2024-bylaws">bylaws</a> require officeholders to have “a voting record of at least 80% in support” of the party’s platform and challengers to sign &#8220;a pledge to support the Wyoming Republican Party platform-related legislation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The question of who is and isn’t a Republican has long plagued the party, and Bextel is still “marinating” on the idea of the new committee but said she’s been asking for input during her travels.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Bryan Miller&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Shortly before retiring from military service, Miller opened a consulting firm in Sheridan in 2010. Since then, he’s served as Sheridan County GOP Chair for several terms and ran unsuccessfully for the Wyoming Legislature, U.S. House and U.S. Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those campaigns, Miller said, gave him the chance to make connections across Wyoming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I have established relationships with county party after county party over the years,” he said. “They call us up here in Sheridan because they like what we have done,” Miller said, pointing to the party&#8217;s growth under his leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>“They like the fact that we took a party that was considered to be iffy in the Republican cause across the state,” Miller said, and turned it “into a party where over 500 people regularly participate in party activities.”</p>

<figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="371" height="434" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BEM-Photo-Social-Media.jpg?resize=371%2C434&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-113638" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BEM-Photo-Social-Media.jpg?w=371&amp;ssl=1 371w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BEM-Photo-Social-Media.jpg?resize=256%2C300&amp;ssl=1 256w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BEM-Photo-Social-Media.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BEM-Photo-Social-Media.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bryan Miller of Sheridan is running to be chair of the Wyoming Republican Party. (Courtesy)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In Sheridan, Miller said, they have a surplus of people willing to volunteer as election judges and poll watchers, and more voters interested in running for precinct committee seats than available spots.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The party’s communication and visibility in the community, Miller said, is responsible for increased participation, which is something he’d like to work on at the state level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Our messaging here in town has been tremendous. We talk to people. We have a headquarters set up on Main Street every election cycle,” Miller said. “We have a presence in Sheridan like no other county when it comes to the Republican Party.”</p>



<p>Miller said he’s also proud of the fundraising strides his local party has made, but there’s more to being chair of the state party than just filling up the coffers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Yes, money is important. It absolutely is when it comes to campaigns and races and all that. But it’s not the reason that someone should elect a chair,” he said. “I don’t want to see that the dollar signs drive the party toward doing things that will not be helpful to the party’s cause.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Miller originally planned to run for vice chair of the party, he said, but a series of events, including a meeting with Bextel, changed his mind. Miller said he also heard from some lawmakers who didn’t take well to Bextel during the session.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My ability to work with the leadership in the House and the Senate is tremendously ahead [of Bextel’s],” Miller said. “I’ve actually already been speaking with the Speaker of the House and the President of the Senate regarding [Wyoming’s election laws] and <a href="https://wyofile.com/hot-springs-county-gop-sues-wyoming-republican-party-for-allegedly-interfering-in-local-elections/">this lawsuit</a> that’s been filed in Hot Springs County.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Miller is running as a “team” alongside Fremont County Chairwoman Ginger Bennett, who is seeking the position of vice chair of the party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Ginger is who I think should be the vice chair,” Miller said. “Because she&#8217;s got that gregarious attitude. And she knows a lot of people. She&#8217;s been involved in the Republican women&#8217;s groups in the state, and it&#8217;s a match that at this point in time is perfect in my opinion.”</p>





<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What now?</strong></h4>



<p>While Saturday’s meeting is open to the public, only county chairs, state committeemen and state committeewomen are allowed to vote in the state party’s officer elections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The meeting starts at 9 a.m. at the Cody Auditorium.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gov. Mark Gordon recently joined several Wyoming business proprietors at a trade show in Taiwan, where Casper-based Backwards Distilling Company and Gillette-based Big Lost Meadery are highly regarded and very popular, he said. But the popularity of Wyoming spirits wasn’t the main thrust of the visit.</p>



<p>In both Taiwan and Japan, Gordon and other Wyoming dignitaries visited with business and ministry officials who are interested in Wyoming&#8217;s coal and natural gas, as well as strengthening partnerships to push carbon capture technologies to help those fossil fuels fit within their low-carbon-emission goals.</p>



<p>Both potential markets rely heavily on energy fuel imports, Gordon said, while officials in Taiwan believe that &#8220;about 20% of their energy mix is going to remain with coal and they&#8217;re very anxious to get Powder River coal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taiwan has its own elected government, but the People&#8217;s Republic of China claims it has sovereignty over the island off its coast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gordon called a press conference Wednesday to highlight his trade mission to the region earlier this month. He was joined by officials from the University of Wyoming, Wyoming Energy Authority as well as representatives from energy producers Jonah Energy, Williams Companies and coal-to-products company Kanata Clean Power &amp; Climate Technologies Corp.</p>



<p>&#8220;It builds confidence, which is very important in Asia,&#8221; Gordon said of the international talks. &#8220;And so this leads us to believe that there is a lot of very exciting opportunity.&#8221;</p>



<p>One primary tangible outcome Gordon hopes to come of strengthening ties with the two foreign markets is to reinvigorate efforts to build coal and natural gas port terminals to increase the international export of those Wyoming commodities. While the U.S. has increased its capacity to export liquified natural gas, efforts to expand coal ports, particularly on the West Coast, have faltered for years.</p>



<p>But Gordon believes that with public-private investment, along with policy support from President Donald Trump, those efforts will be revitalized.</p>



<p>It will require &#8220;looking at whether the Millennium Bulk Terminal can be reinvigorated, or Jordan Cove [terminal] or whether a couple of these other things in Oakland that have been talked about from time to time could come to fruition,&#8221; Gordon said. Increasing Wyoming&#8217;s fossil fuel exports might also require &#8220;going out of the Gulf of America [Gulf of Mexico] and going through the Panama Canal,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Asked whether the state&#8217;s trade efforts might help the beleaguered Kemmerer coal mine land export contracts in time to save it from potentially closing, Gordon said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a silver bullet for that right now. But I can tell you, I&#8217;m rummaging around in my ammo box for it.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Carbon capture hopes and Kemmerer coal</strong></h4>



<p>Kemmerer Operations LLC <a href="https://wyofile.com/kemmerer-coal-mine-lays-off-28-workers/">recently laid off 28 workers</a>, and many in southwest Wyoming worry there may be more job losses, or that <a href="https://wyofile.com/coal-layoffs-leave-wyoming-community-grappling-with-good-bad-of-energy-transition/">the mine might even close</a>.</p>



<p>The mine’s biggest customer — the nearby Naughton power plant, which accounts for about 42% of the mine’s coal production, according to federal documents — will stop burning coal by the end of the year as its owner, PacifiCorp, converts the plant to natural gas fuel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There remains a mix of hope and skepticism for two proposals to tap the Kemmerer coal mine for coal-to-products projects — potentially making up for the pending loss of the Naughton coal contract. In fact, an official from <a href="https://kanataclean.com/">Kanata Clean Power &amp; Climate Technologies Corp.</a> joined Gordon on the Japan and Taiwan trade mission.</p>

(Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The company proposes a multi-billion-dollar effort to cleanly convert about 1.8 million tons of Kemmerer coal annually into ammonia, primarily as an agricultural fertilizer. Another company, <a href="https://www.trisightglobal.com/about-us">TriSight LLC</a>, claims to have &#8220;unlocked&#8221; a process to convert the coal into myriad products, including graphite, agricultural fertilizer and makeup — using about 1 million tons per year from the Kemmerer mine, all while avoiding coal&#8217;s typical carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But neither project appears on the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council&#8217;s <a href="https://deq.wyoming.gov/industrial-siting-2/council/">working list of applications</a> — a required regulatory step for such projects. Taken at face value, the lack of an ISC permit application indicates that neither proposal is likely to consume Kemmerer coal within the next year or so.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Wyoming coal-to-ammonia project team is evaluating multiple siting alternatives, a list of alternatives that includes the Kemmerer mine surface lease,&#8221; F.E. “Wally” Wolski, who works with Kanata, told WyoFile via email.</p>





<p>Although WyoFile has not fully investigated the financial preparedness of either TriSight or Kanata, some southwest Wyoming officials regard both coal-to-products proposals as a potential lifeline for the mine. Kemmerer City Administrator Brian Muir told WyoFile that both projects underscore signs of a potential rebound in the coal market and the potential for technologies to find new uses for coal.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is not over yet,&#8221; Muir told WyoFile in March. &#8220;There&#8217;s years and years of coal reserves here, and technologies to convert [coal into products].&#8221;</p>



<p>Among the most exciting topics discussed on his trade mission to Japan and Taiwan, Gordon said, was an agreement to support coal technologies that reduce its carbon footprint.</p>



<p>&#8220;[We talked] about the progression of technologies that could go forward, and that generated a lot of excitement,&#8221; Gordon said.</p>
