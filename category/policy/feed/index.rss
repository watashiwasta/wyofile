But congressional budgeting could kill it."></a></p>
<p>As the Wyoming Legislature met in early February, a lawmaker from the state’s southwest corner announced to his fellow representatives that the Trump administration had thrown out the Bureau of Land Management’s controversial Rock Springs resource management plan, <a href="https://wyofile.com/biden-administration-finalizes-rock-springs-plan-without-further-changes/">completed just weeks before</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But word of its death, <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/02/06/trump-administration-shuts-down-controversial-biden-era-rock-springs-management-plan/">parroted by</a> some in the media, was premature. U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s <a href="https://www.doi.gov/document-library/secretary-order/so-3418-unleashing-american-energy">“Unleashing American Energy” order</a>, which triggered the erroneous reports, said that the <a href="https://wyofile.com/blms-final-rock-springs-plan-seeks-balance-of-resource-development-and-wildlife-protections/">final plan for 3.6 million acres</a> of the Red Desert and checkerboard region would be &#8220;reviewed and, as appropriate, revised.&#8221; Months later, the federal resource management plan remains in effect.</p>



<p>“It’s still active. It’s not frozen,” BLM-Wyoming spokesman Micky Fisher told WyoFile. “We are now just identifying possible options.”</p>



<p>What path BLM takes to satisfy Burgum’s order is being decided at the agency’s Washington headquarters, Fisher said. Amending the plan through the established National Environmental Policy Act review process is among the options, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-do-the-secretary-of-the-interiors-recent-orders-mean/id1395671263?i=1000698239250">policy experts have predicted.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Congress, however, could take away BLM’s ability to decide for itself. Wyoming’s lone U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman has <a href="https://wyofile.com/in-new-leadership-post-hageman-takes-fresh-aim-at-federal-land-grizzly-policies/">brought such bills</a>. Her staff did not respond to a request Monday seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Hageman-8.6.24-c.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, pictured in 2024 at a town hall in Jackson, has spearheaded efforts to rescind the Bureau of Land Management&#8217;s Rock Springs Resource Management Plan via congressional action. (Angus M. Thuermer, Jr./WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>There has also been <a href="https://wyofile.com/gop-led-congress-could-toss-rock-springs-plan-in-2025-using-an-unprecedented-move/">talk of using the Congressional Review Act</a> to overturn the land-use plan, which was <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/02/01/2011-2201/notice-of-intent-to-prepare-a-resource-management-plan-for-the-rock-springs-field-office-wyoming-and">nearly 14 years in the making</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet another possible route for Congress to undo the plan, which <a href="https://wyofile.com/misinformation-hysteria-dominate-response-to-blms-plan-for-sw-wyoming/">caused a political furor</a> during its draft stages, is to address it during the ongoing budget reconciliation process. That remains on the table.</p>



<p>Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, included two provisions in his <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II00/20250506/118151/BILLS-119-CommitteePrint-W000821-Amdt-012.pdf">draft reconciliation bill</a> that address BLM resource management plans in Wyoming. One would not allow the BLM to “implement, administer or enforce” the RMP for its Rock Springs field office. The other includes the same prohibitionary language for BLM acting on its new plan for its Buffalo Field Office — which includes a coal-leasing ban in the Powder River Basin that’s now <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-montana-sue-feds-to-repeal-powder-river-basin-coal-leasing-ban/">being litigated</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/notice_--_full_committee_markup_of_committee_print_05.06.25.pdf">markup of the draft reconciliation bill is scheduled for 8:15 a.m.</a> MST on Tuesday. Ultimately, the provisions could lead to the Rock Springs and Buffalo plans being killed by only a simple majority vote — budget reconciliation isn’t subject to the filibuster, so only 51 votes are needed to get it through the U.S. Senate.</p>



<p>That’s a possibility that has conservation groups in Wyoming on guard. Congress — via budget reconciliation or otherwise — has never successfully thrown out a federal land-use plan, said Julia Stuble, Wyoming director for The Wilderness Society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We can&#8217;t find an example of this kind of congressional overreach … being successful,&#8221; Stuble said. “We’ve certainly seen some attempts at this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not a sure thing that the resource management plan provisions will carry forward. Provisions in budget reconciliation must have a direct effect on the federal budget, and it’s unclear if congressional rules would allow for RMP provisions.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lt.-MT-Elk-herd-sbb_14111.jpeg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A large elk herd kicks up a cloud of dust as it evacuates a hillside on Little Mountain, a peak east of Flaming Gorge Reservoir within the Bureau of Land Management’s Rock Springs Field Office. (Steven Brutger)</figcaption></figure>



<p>If congressional Republicans do carry the provisions forward successfully, it’d set a bad precedent in Stuble’s view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think anyone who believes that the small government closest to the people is the best form of government should be opposed to this kind of overreach from Congress,” she said. “Because land-use plans, like RMPs, are developed at a local level, with tons of input from elected officials, community members and stakeholders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not everyone in Wyoming is on that page. Rep. Cody Wylie, a Republican representative from Rock Springs who prematurely announced the RMP’s death during the legislative session, believes that local interests were cut out of the BLM’s process. That decision charted the future of millions of acres of public land surrounding his legislative district.</p>



<p>“The way it was written, it was completely biased — not even conservation, but preservation,” Wylie said. “That’s just not realistic for the state of Wyoming. Our economy has run off of the extraction industries.” </p>



<p>Efforts to strike more of a balance between <a href="https://wyofile.com/blms-final-rock-springs-plan-seeks-balance-of-resource-development-and-wildlife-protections/">conservation and industrial development in the final plan</a> didn’t alleviate his concerns.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wylie prefers that Congress not throw the plan out entirely, so the BLM doesn’t have to start from scratch. An amendment to the 2024 plan, he said, would be ideal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Then they can [include] all that informational work that&#8217;s been done over the last 15 years,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if congressional Republicans successfully throw out the new plan and BLM has to revert to its 1997 RMP, he won&#8217;t protest.</p>



<p>“I think we can live with that until we redo the RMP process,” Wylie said.</p>

<p>Sweetwater County educators did not keep information from the parents of a Rock Springs high school student who asked to be called by a preferred name and pronouns, a federal judge ruled Monday.</p>



<p>U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl reached that conclusion en route to dismissing a lawsuit brought by the child’s parents, who had alleged the district violated their rights by deliberately concealing information about their child’s name and pronoun choices. The student’s mother, a public school teacher in Sweetwater County, further alleged that her First Amendment religious rights were violated by district policies that direct staff about how to handle students’ preferred names and pronouns.</p>



<p>Skavdahl rebuffed both allegations, agreeing with Sweetwater County School District 1 lawyers that the case should be decided in the educators’ favor before it reached a jury.</p>



<p>“The undisputed facts establish that Defendants did not withhold or knowingly misrepresent any information regarding the Student from or to Plaintiff, and thus did not interfere with this right,” Skavdahl wrote. “Neither did Defendants’ conduct burden Plaintiff’s First Amendment right to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a parent or unconstitutionally interfere with her right to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a teacher.”</p>



<p>The student’s parents, Ashley and Sean Willey, sued Sweetwater County School District 1 leaders and educators in April 2023. They asked the court to bar the district from using any names or pronouns other than the ones their teenager was given at birth without prior written consent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ashley Willey also asked the court to block the district from forcing her, as a teacher, to use her students’ preferred pronouns or names. Willey did not use students’ preferred pronouns and names as a teacher, and she testified she was never disciplined or retaliated against for her decision, according to Skavdahl’s ruling.</p>



<p>The Willey family filed the lawsuit amid rising concerns, often expressed by conservative-leaning parents, that schools were influencing student decisions about gender identity. That spurred efforts to <a href="https://wyofile.com/book-challenges-content-controversies-roil-fremont-county-libraries/">ban or limit access to certain LGBTQ+ books</a> at school and public libraries in Wyoming. State lawmakers also brought measures designed to <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/HB0200">prevent school districts</a> and <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/SF0077">public employees</a> from being required to use preferred pronouns and names, while requiring schools to provide parents with more information about their children. A school district pronoun bill died in the state Senate while the state-employee focused legislation became law without Gov. Mark Gordon’s signature.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Wyoming’s schools superintendent, Megan Degenfelder, <a href="https://edu.wyoming.gov/wyoming-superintendent-of-public-instruction-megan-degenfelder-announces-2025-legislative-priorities/">also pushed for a requirement</a> that schools receive parental consent before using a child’s preferred name or pronouns.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Parental rights, district obligations</strong></h4>



<p>In the Willeys’ lawsuit, the parents alleged their child asked teachers and staff at Black Butte High School in Rock Springs to be called by a male name and pronouns starting in the 2021-22 school year. They accused the district of keeping that development from them by continuing to use the child’s gender assigned at birth in their presence, while using the teen’s preferred name and pronouns in school.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During depositions, three school staff members testified they used the student’s preferred name and pronouns during the 2021-22 school year. Another teacher did so in an email exchange during the 2022-23 school year.</p>



<p>The Willeys asserted that the district should have proactively informed them about their child’s change in name and pronouns because parents have a right to make decisions about their children’s well-being, including their physical and mental health.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Skavdahl noted that such a stance would be impractical, as there are a “laundry list of circumstances that could affect a child’s ‘well-being’ even in the slightest that would require constant, detailed information sharing from the school, with constitutional consequences.”</p>



<p>The judge agreed that parents have a right to know about their child’s gender identity choices if parents seek that information from schools. But he drew a distinction between a district knowingly keeping that information from a parent and a district that provides such information only when asked.</p>



<p>“The Court does not think the information can properly be deemed ‘withheld’ to infringe on parental rights unless a parent inquired into or sought the information and it was intentionally concealed or they were lied to,” Skavdahl wrote. “Otherwise, an infinite amount of information would be deemed ‘withheld’ by schools on a daily basis in violation of parental rights.”</p>



<p>“The District and its staff members merely respected the Student’s voluntary choice to be referred to by preferred name and pronouns,” the judge wrote later in the opinion. “Neither the District nor its staff members required the Student go by preferred name or pronouns nor did they ‘discourage students from discussing their gender identities with their parents.’”</p>



<p>Moreover, the school district shared information with the parents about their child’s preferred name and pronouns when that information was sought, the judge noted.</p>



<p>Skavdahl also rejected the Willeys’ arguments that educators facilitated the student’s gender transition socially, and thus, invalidated the parents’ right to make medical decisions for their teen.</p>



<p>“Plaintiff offers no evidence that the school provided any type of ‘medical transition’ or even ‘facilitated’ the Student’s ‘social transitioning,’” Skavdahl wrote. “Defendants were not involved in changing the Student’s clothing or hairstyle. Plaintiff did not set forth any facts that staff members even encouraged or suggested the Student engage in such behaviors, but simply that staff members passively respected the Student’s request to be referred to by preferred name and pronouns.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Freedom of religion</strong></h4>



<p>Skavdahl also denied Ashley Willey’s claims that the district violated her freedom of religion, both as a parent and as a teacher. She had argued the district’s failure to inform her about her child’s gender identity changes interfered with her religious beliefs because it kept her from information she needed to counsel her child.</p>



<p>But that reasoning would create an obligation on the part of the district to foster the exercise of Willey’s religious beliefs, the judge wrote.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>To conclude that the District’s failure to act in accordance with Plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”</p><cite>Judge scott skavdahl</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>“Plaintiff’s allegations, more plainly, are that the District staff members’ use, at the Student’s request, of preferred name and pronouns were counter to Plaintiff’s own religious beliefs,” he wrote. “However, a person’s constitutional right to freely exercise their own religious beliefs does not require that the state also exercise those same religious beliefs … To conclude that the District’s failure to act in accordance with Plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”</p>



<p>As to Willey’s assertions that being required to follow the district’s policies concerning preferred pronouns and names violated her religious rights, Skavdahl was unswayed. Those policies were “neutral laws of general applicability,” they don’t raise concerns about the free exercise of religion and must only be “rationally related to a legitimate government interest” to be considered constitutional. That interest, Skavdahl wrote, involved promoting an educational environment that’s both respectful and without discrimination.</p>

<p>As the Department of the Interior develops a plan to “restore American prosperity” by exploiting Western natural resources, a Wyoming attorney who has steeled rural communities against federal policies is atop the hierarchy that will marshal the effort.</p>



<p>Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum last month <a href="https://www.doi.gov/document-library/secretary-order/so-3414-a5-amendment-so-3414-establishment-new-department">appointed</a> Karen Budd-Falen as temporary deputy secretary and his senior advisor. As the department fleshes out a four-year strategic plan to use natural resources across <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R42346.pdf">19.9 million acres</a> of national parks and Bureau of Land Management property in Wyoming, Budd-Falen will be in the Interior’s second-highest position.</p>



<p>A draft of the <a href="https://www.publicdomain.media/p/interior-trump-draft-strategic-plan?utm_source=Master%2BPress%2BList%2B2.0&amp;utm_campaign=8df86253dc-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_04_23_04_19&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-8df86253dc-84285649">four-year Interior plan</a> leaked to Public Domain outlines department objectives for prosperity, security and recreation. Conservationists have decried elements they say would dismantle environmental safeguards, turn over federal property, promote energy development and favor rural communities over nationwide interests.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“It is irresponsible for a media outlet to publish a draft document.” </p><cite>Department of the Interior<br></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The Interior Department last week blasted the leak and called its publication “irresponsible.”</p>



<p>“It is beyond unacceptable that an internal document in the draft/deliberative process is being shared with the media before a decision point has been made,” Interior’s press office wrote WyoFile on Thursday. “Not only is this unacceptable behavior, it is irresponsible for a media outlet to publish a draft document.</p>



<p>“We will take this leak of an internal, pre-decisional document very seriously and find out who is responsible,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>The draft plan, which the agency said is “not final nor ready for release,” sets four goals and several objectives to accomplish them. Interior’s drafted goals are to restore American prosperity, ensure national security through infrastructure and innovation, and allow sustainable enjoyment of natural resources. It would do all that through the fourth goal — collaboration with states, tribes and local governments.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>American prosperity</strong></h4>



<p>The draft plan to restore American prosperity would use American energy to “lower… costs and increases affordability.” But it includes elements that worry conservationists who fear damage to Interior agencies including the National Park Service, BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p>



<p>The plan would “deregulate” to increase “clean coal” production and oil and gas drilling. It would streamline the National Environmental Policy Act, a law designed to safeguard the environment. And it would reduce the cost of grazing, which critics say is already too low.</p>

<p>The draft would “release federal holdings” — divest Americans of their public property — to allow states and communities to reduce housing costs. Interior would support agriculture and increase revenues from logging, non-energy mining, and grazing. The draft treats natural resources as assets, viewing federal holdings for the economic value that can be derived from them.</p>



<p>The leaked document “reads like an industry wish list,” the <a href="https://westernpriorities.org/">Center for Western Priorities</a> said in a statement. It includes “a thinly veiled reference to the seizure and sale of public lands,” according to the conservation group.</p>



<p>The draft treats the West’s natural resources “as nothing more than numbers on a balance sheet,” Western Priorities Executive Director Jennifer Rokala said in a statement. In the plan, those resources are “products to be sold off and exploited to help pay for tax cuts for Elon Musk and Trump&#8217;s fellow billionaires,” she said.</p>



<p>“It resembles a business plan from a desperate CEO, not a framework to steward public lands for the benefit of all Americans,” Rokala’s statement reads.</p>

<p>To her post, Budd-Falen brings years of experience fighting for ranchers and other public land users and developers. The federal government has been a frequent adversary, but so has <a href="https://www.westernwatersheds.org/about/">Western Watersheds Project</a>, another conservation group that focuses on public land grazing.</p>



<p>She represented a group of ranchers who <a href="https://wyofile.com/water-war-continues-despite-court-settlement/">sued Western Watersheds</a> for trespassing when a field worker collected water to test for pollution caused by grazing. She <a href="https://wyofile.com/budd-falen-provocateur-protector/">advised rural counties</a> to adopt land use plans they could leverage when contesting federal programs on public land in their areas. She also represented stock growers who <a href="https://wyofile.com/stock-growers-judge-in-corner-crossing-case-misunderstood-new-trespass-law/">sided against</a> four Missouri hunters who corner crossed to hunt public land on Elk Mountain in Carbon County. She represented the Cliven Bundy family and others as they fought grazing reductions imposed after Las Vegas developers were permitted to occupy desert tortoise habitat. That family later became infamous for armed standoffs with federal officials over use of public land.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conservation measures</strong></h4>



<p>The draft plan includes numerous other elements like supporting law enforcement, disseminating science and managing lands to reduce wildfire risk. It would reduce the federal infrastructure footprint and ensure public lands meet visitors’ needs. The draft envisions clean and adequate amounts of water.</p>



<p>Interior would restore historic names, some of which have been changed to recognize indigenous monikers or demote racist figures. The department would “right size” national monuments, according to the draft.</p>





<p>A goal to “enjoy our natural resources while ensuring they remain sound and sustainable,” includes a variety of conservation measures, according to the draft. Species and natural resources would be protected and ecosystems would be healthy and balanced, the draft said. Progress could be measured by the number of species taken off threatened and endangered lists, according to the draft.</p>



<p>Abandoned mines and wells would be cleaned up, the draft proposes. The department would support co-management of its properties with “local stakeholders and tribes,” the draft states.</p>



<p>Burgum appointed Budd-Falen “to facilitate the prompt and effective accession of the Trump administration’s leadership team,” his order states. She will serve until the Senate confirms high Interior Department personnel appointed by President Trump, but no longer than through May 31.</p>



<p>The timeline for public engagement is from May 16 to July 18, with publication, or final adoption, set for Oct. 1. The strategic plan is a “bold, outcome-driven roadmap for how we deliver impact to the American people,” the draft states.</p>

<p>Following a March town hall in Wheatland, an elderly woman approached Rep. Harriet Hageman and spoke in an “aggressive manner” with her hands close to the representative’s face, a Wheatland Police Department report released to WyoFile this week shows.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Hageman’s staff members moved between the elderly woman and the lawmaker, and a Wheatland police officer took hold of the elderly woman’s wrists. The woman apologized and walked away, according to the report. No charges were filed and the officer does not appear to have taken down the woman’s name.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were no other incidents that required law enforcement either during or after the event, <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/W25-0808-Report-Request-WyoFile-1.pdf">according to Wheatland Police Sgt. Dalton Minsaas&#8217; report</a>. </p>



<p>Hageman <a href="https://wyofile.com/hageman-cancels-in-person-town-halls-opts-for-virtual-events-citing-safety-concerns/">cited the Wheatland incident</a> as one of the safety threats that spurred her to move her town halls online for a time. Hageman this week restarted in-person town halls in Buffalo and Dayton, but required people to register for them ahead of time.</p>



<p>The Wheatland police report aligns with Hageman’s account of the incident, but provides more detail. &nbsp;</p>



<p>“An attendee followed Hageman leaving the venue and initiated a physical confrontation with staff, into which local police were forced to intervene,” Hageman’s staff wrote in their March statement about moving town halls online.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The March 20 Wheatland town hall followed a raucous event in Laramie the night before, where <a href="https://wyofile.com/crowd-jeers-hageman-at-tense-laramie-town-hall-she-calls-them-hysterical/">Hageman was booed and heckled by people</a> upset by the actions of President Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk. Still, law enforcement at the Laramie event told WyoFile there were no incidents and officers did not remove anyone.</p>

Harriet Hageman on March 19, 2025, at her town hall event in Laramie. (Megan Johnson/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Wheatland, security was significant and led by the Platte County Sheriff’s Office. Four Wheatland PD officers joined deputies guarding the event, with different assignments, according to a second police report released to WyoFile, this one written by Sgt. Russell Swingle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hageman also cited the strain placed on law enforcement resources as a reason for moving her events online. In Buffalo on Thursday night, she met a mixed reception that included both support and jeering, the Cowboy State Daily reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were no incidents that required an intervention from law enforcement, Buffalo Police Department Captain Garth Nicholas told WyoFile on Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WyoFile requested the Wheatland reports under the Wyoming Public Records Act on March 27. They were released Thursday, although it’s not clear when the reports were written. Traci Swingle, the department’s administrative assistant, told WyoFile she was unable to provide that information.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Constituent anger</strong></h4>



<p>Republican lawmakers nationwide have faced anger and indignation from their constituents when they’ve returned from Washington, D.C. to their home states, as the Musk-led DOGE initiative continues to <a href="https://wyofile.com/valentines-day-massacre-uncounted-throng-of-wyomingites-fired-by-trump-administration/">sharply reduce</a> and <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-and-musks-doge-functionally-destroying-historic-yellowstone-grizzly-science-team/">restructure government programs</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hageman cast the people who heckled her in Laramie and elsewhere as organized protesters, and some conservatives falsely suggested they had come into the state from elsewhere to flood the events — or were even paid protesters.</p>



<p>The police reports show Hageman faced upset constituents in Wheatland too.</p>



<p>“During the town hall, I could hear ‘boos’ from the crowd,” wrote Swingle, who was posted in the lobby of Wheatland High School, where the town hall was held.</p>



<p>Minsaas was standing by the high school auditorium’s entrance as people were exiting. Hageman came up a set of stairs toward the doors where Minsaas was posted, and the officer watched “an elderly female” who was “moving in a quick manner to get close to Hageman.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of Hageman’s staffers, who is not named in the report, stepped between the two women, Minsaas wrote. Hageman’s staff did not respond to a WyoFile request for additional details about the incident.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The elderly female was communicating to Hageman in what appeared to be an aggressive manner,” Minsaas wrote. “I also observed the elderly female’s hands were up and close to Hageman’s face.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The officer “gained control” of the constituent’s wrists, he wrote, and “explained to her that she could communicate with Hageman, but she needed to keep her hands to her side.” The woman apologized and walked away.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hageman’s staff and law enforcement walked with the congresswoman out of the building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There is nothing further to report on this matter,” Minsaas concluded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A former library official is pushing back against the political forces that ended her decades-long career in the Campbell County Public Library system, bringing her second of two federal lawsuits this month, accusing local government and an activist family of discrimination and wrongful termination.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Campbell County Public Library System Board of Trustees fired Terri Lesley from her job in July 2023, after the director of the county library system resisted calls to censure books dealing with questions of sexuality among teens and young adults, particularly LGBTQ+ youth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Two months after her firing, Lesley sued members of a family, the Bennetts, who had prominently advocated for her removal as library director. This week, she brought a new federal lawsuit against the county, its board of commissioners, the library board and individual members of both government boards. The new suit accuses local officials of violating the First Amendment’s right to free speech and firing Lesley in a retaliatory and discriminatory way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sage Bear, who sits on the library board and is the wife of House Appropriations Chairman and Wyoming Freedom Caucus leader John Bear, is one of the defendants. Lesley’s lawsuit alleges Sage Bear played a key role in driving the librarian from her job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By text message, Rep. Bear said he believed his wife had been counseled not to comment by her attorneys. WyoFile reached out to the private attorneys on both sides of Lesley’s lawsuits, including her Denver-based law firm, but did not receive responses by day’s end Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>

(Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>A representative for the Campbell County Attorney’s office said it was too early for the agency to comment on the lawsuit against the county, which was filed Monday. Court records indicate the county has yet to be served with the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lesley notched a legal victory in her first lawsuit earlier this month, as U.S. District Court of Wyoming Judge Alan Johnson ruled that half of her claims against the Bennetts can proceed to trial. He also tossed a motion for dismissal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both lawsuits come as the Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which controls the House, promises to thrust the Legislature into the debate over library books. The Legislature’s Joint Judiciary Committee has taken on the state’s obscenity laws as a topic to study from now until the 2026 legislative session, and conservative lawmakers will likely push for laws banning books that discuss sexuality from libraries where they can be accessed by minors.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Librarian directors from around the state opposed a bill along those lines during the most recent legislative session. The House Judiciary Committee ultimately tabled that bill, electing to study it between sessions.</p>



<p>Lesley’s firing marked the culmination of two years of fierce political debate in Campbell County, during which Lesley became a target of activists opposed to LGBTQ+ literature for young people in public libraries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those activists, namely the Bennett family, called for Lesley to be fired and even pressed the Campbell County District Attorney’s Office to charge her for providing obscene material to minors, according to the longer-running lawsuit, which Lesley filed in September 2023. It names as defendants Kevin, Hugh and Susan Bennett.</p>



<p>Prosecutors declined to bring charges after conducting what they described as an extensive review of state statutes. The county attorney found that the books in question did not meet the statute’s definition of obscene materials, which requires sexual content to also lack “serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”</p>



<p>WyoFile reached Kevin Bennett by phone on Wednesday, and he declined to comment.</p>



<p>In their response to Lesley’s lawsuit, an attorney for the Bennetts says they were exercising their own free speech rights and were not responsible for firing Lesley.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Policy debate</strong></h4>



<p>The Joint Judiciary Committee, which meets next month for the first time since the conclusion of the 2025 legislative session, does not have a set direction when it comes to the obscenity law topic, House chairman Art Washut, R-Casper, told WyoFile. The committee might pursue a change to criminal statutes as outlined in this year’s failed bill, or seek to “compel school districts and library boards to certify compliance in some way,” he wrote in a text message.</p>



<p>“It is wide open at this point, but there was strong support to rein in the idea that open access of all materials to kids is appropriate,” Washut wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Conservatives are trying to outlaw LGBTQ+ material under the guise of protecting children, said Sara Burlingame, executive director of gay-rights advocacy group Wyoming Equality. Library books that describe the experience of LGBTQ+ youth carry immense value to young people grappling with their emerging sexuality, she said, particularly in Wyoming’s rural communities and small towns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Wyoming Equality supports the freedom to access books for the public,” she said. “Anything that reinforces that the public is made up of a diverse group of individuals which includes gay, lesbian, Two Spirit and transgender people, that has to be fought for over and over again.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The drive to create new laws targeting certain books was irreconcilable with American democratic ideals, she said. Any effort to stand up to that, like Lesley’s lawsuit, was cheered by Wyoming Equality, she said.</p>



<p>“People keep waiting for what the line is, and when they’re coming for books, that’s it,” she said. “That’s your cue. That’s the line.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In the crosshairs after a long career</strong></h4>



<p>According to her lawsuit, Lesley spent 27 years working for the library system, and 11 as its director. “In 2021, however, the highly politicized vilification of LGBTQ+ communities and book-banning craze engulfing the country landed on her doorstep, with grave consequences,” her attorneys wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bigotry, not genuine concern for young people, drove Campbell County activists to push Lesley out of her job, and local officials abetted them instead of standing firm for free speech and equal rights, the lawsuit alleged. </p>



<p>In June, which is Pride Month, of that year, the library system made a Facebook post celebrating Rainbow Book Month — an initiative of the American Library Association, which describes it as a “nationwide celebration” of books reflecting the lives and experiences of LGBTQ+ people. That post caught the attention of two then-county commissioners, Del Shelstad and Colleen Faber, who are both defendants in this week’s lawsuit.</p>



<p>According to the suit, Shelstad said the county commission had not recognized Pride Month, though it is a national celebration and President Joe Biden had recognized it that year. Shelstad and Faber did not respond to WyoFile messages requesting comment.</p>

<p>After that, library books became a topic of frequent discussion at Campbell County Commission meetings. Hugh Bennett suggested promoting Pride Month was “the ground game of an attempt to destroy our culture and our country,” while Kevin Bennett said exposing young people to questions of sexuality was “pedophilic” and would drive increases in drug addiction and suicide, according to the complaint.</p>



<p>“The Bennetts and other activist residents voiced explicit anti-LGBTQ+ rationales for their requests to remove books, virulently vilifying LGBTQ+ individuals,” the lawsuit read.</p>



<p>At another meeting, former lawmaker Scott Clem, who is now on the Campbell County Commission, said the library was “promoting the basest of base things in our society,” the complaint read, and urged the county not to “promote animalistic behaviors.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 2021, the library board backed Lesley, supporting her efforts to promote Rainbow Book Month, according to the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lesley’s hiring of a magician further inflamed Campbell County’s conservatives. The magician, who was hired to perform shows at the Wright and Gillette branches, is transgender, though her gender identity was not part of her planned act, which was instead a simple magic show for children. The show did not touch on LGBTQ+ issues at all, the magician said at the time, and Lesley has said the performer was not hired because she was transgender.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Library staff did not in fact know the magician was transgender until someone in Campbell County dug into her background, according to the lawsuit. But Shelstad, Clem and others fixated on the magician’s gender identity, according to the lawsuit.</p>



<p>Eventually, the magician cancelled the shows, citing safety concerns.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Controversy, then firing&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Throughout 2021 and 2022, the Bennetts and others sought to get some books removed from the library or move them into a certain area inaccessible to minors. Lesley and the library board continued to rebuff those efforts, saying it would be illegal censorship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over time, however, the county commission replaced the library board with people, like Sage Bear, who were more determined to censor certain books, and who opposed Lesley’s stance. In March 2022, a deputy county attorney sought to warn Shelstad that appointing a board with the goal of removing LGBTQ-friendly books and firing Lesley could expose the county to a lawsuit.</p>



<p>“Litigation regarding censorship — which is waiting in the wings on all sides — would be cripplingly costly, time consuming, and very likely unsuccessful for the County,” the attorney wrote, according to a copy of her email included in the lawsuit.</p>



<p>But by July 2023, the board was dominated by people opposed to Lesley’s actions, and she was fired in a 4-1 vote. At the board’s request, her replacement created a special section in the library for the challenged books, according to the lawsuit. </p>



<p>Lesley’s lawsuits have the support of the Wyoming Library Association, which represents the state’s librarians. “Terri dedicated her career to providing library services to her community,” the group’s president, Lindsey Travis, wrote in a statement to WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyoming libraries do not hold materials that are legally considered obscene, Travis said, and “we believe that only parents and guardians have the right to decide what materials are best for their own children.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Travis hopes Lesley’s lawsuit will get the attention of the state’s politicians, she said, and “encourage lawmakers to better understand the purpose of their local libraries, to see how libraries hold essential roles in their communities, and to support the ways libraries and librarians uphold the tenets of the First Amendment.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>A state judge Monday halted enforcement of Wyoming’s two new abortion laws, clearing the way for the state’s lone abortion clinic to resume offering those services after a nearly two-month pause.</p>



<p>The laws — a set of new, more stringent regulations and a mandatory ultrasound requirement — “affect a fundamental right expressly provided for by the Wyoming Constitution,” District Judge Thomas T.C. Campbell wrote in his 10-page decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At least at this juncture, the State Defendants failed demonstrating that the laws are necessary, reasonable, or advance a compelling government interest,” Campbell wrote. “In fact, the uncontested evidence indicates otherwise.”</p>



<p>Wellspring Health Access in Casper stopped providing abortions in late February after the Wyoming Legislature passed the new abortion restrictions. It had been the only clinic in the state providing procedural abortions. In the month following the new laws, it referred <a href="https://wyofile.com/casper-abortion-clinic-remains-in-limbo-as-judge-mulls-temporary-halt-to-new-regulations/">80 patients seeking abortions </a>to out-of-state providers.</p>

<p>Following Campbell’s ruling, Wellspring announced it would reopen for abortion services on Thursday. Julie Burkhart, the clinic’s president, called it a “great day for Wyoming.” Burkhart described the new laws as political gimmicks that were “designed to sidestep constitutional protections.”</p>



<p>“These laws have placed burdens on patients and their families, adding stress instead of support,” she said in a statement. “Wyomingites don’t need government overreach in their personal health decisions — they need leadership from their elected leaders who will partner with us for the best possible health care.”</p>



<p><a href="https://wyofile.com/abortion-clinic-files-lawsuit-to-block-new-wyoming-laws/">Wellspring and other abortion providers and advocates filed suit</a> the day after the first of the new laws went into effect and asked a judge to halt their enforcement while the case played out. Their attorneys maintain the restrictions — including one that <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-enacts-new-abortion-clinic-rules-raising-questions-about-casper-facilitys-future/">requires abortion clinics to be regulated as “ambulatory surgical centers”</a> — are thinly veiled attempts to block abortion in Wyoming after a separate district judge threw out two abortion bans passed by the Legislature in 2023. Abortion advocates maintain the laws don’t make women any safer and are intended to target Wellspring directly.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Constitutional amendment</h4>



<p>In making their case, the plaintiffs’ attorneys cited a 2012 amendment to the Wyoming Constitution that protects people’s rights to make their own health care decisions. The same attorneys used that amendment to convince Teton County District Judge Melissa Owens to <a href="https://wyofile.com/judge-strikes-down-wyoming-abortion-bans/">overturn the 2023 abortion bans</a>.</p>



<p>In his ruling Monday, Campbell centered his decision on the same constitutional amendment. He rejected the state’s arguments that both new laws protected the health and welfare of women seeking abortions. He noted that the state failed to provide any evidence challenging the plaintiffs’ assertions that surgical abortions are inherently safe, nor did they offer an explanation for why requiring the doctors at Wellspring to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital is reasonable or necessary.</p>



<p>“Quite simply, the State Defendants fail to link [ambulatory surgical center] requirements to women&#8217;s safety and general welfare,” he wrote. “In fact, the evidence presented by the Plaintiffs stands largely uncontroverted.”</p>

<p>Campbell also expressed skepticism toward the state’s arguments for the medical necessity of the <a href="https://wyofile.com/senate-overrides-gordons-veto-of-abortion-bill-requiring-transvaginal-ultrasounds-in-wyoming/">ultrasound</a> and 48-hour-waiting-period requirements.</p>



<p>“That a transvaginal ultrasound is necessary to obtain informed consent offends common sense,” he wrote. “The State Defendants assert that such practice could potentially identify ectopic pregnancies earlier; thus, generally promoting women&#8217;s health. However, the fact that only women seeking abortions would benefit, corrodes that argument.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Ruling reaction</strong></h4>



<p>In their lawsuit, attorneys for the plaintiffs questioned the state’s arguments over safety. They cited comments by Speaker of the House Chip Neiman, R-Hulett, who has <a href="https://wyofile.com/house-speaker-senate-bound-abortion-restrictions-are-about-more-than-safety/">publicly said his support for new abortion laws</a> was focused on ending the practice entirely instead of simply making it safer. As of late Monday afternoon, Neiman had not responded to a request for comment from WyoFile.</p>



<p>The Wyoming Freedom Caucus, of which Neiman is a member, released a statement criticizing Campbell and the ruling. The group described the new laws as common-sense regulations and said its members were “deeply disturbed&#8221; by the decision.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rep. Martha Lawley, R-Worland, sponsored the abortion regulation bill. She did not respond to a message seeking comment Monday, but has said in the past that Wyoming had a “real lack of regulation” in the area of surgical abortions.</p>



<p>Abortion rights advocates cheered Monday’s decision.</p>



<p>“The Court found what we all know — these restrictions are unnecessary, offend common sense and, as Judge Campbell said about the 48-hour waiting period, serve no legitimate purpose,” Christine Lichtenfels, executive director Chelsea’s Fund, an abortion aid group and plaintiff in the case, said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We are so grateful that Wyoming women will once again be able to access vital abortion care without unreasonable and unnecessary restrictions.”</p>



<p>The case took a winding route to reach Monday’s injunction. The plaintiffs filed suit in Natrona County on Feb. 28 and sought an emergency hearing. When Judge Dan Forgey didn’t act on their request after 12 days, they refiled the case in Teton County. It landed before Owens, <a href="https://wyofile.com/judge-dismisses-suit-against-wyomings-new-anti-abortion-laws/">who ruled it belonged in Natrona County</a> — home of Wellspring — and sent it back.</p>

<p>When it returned, the case was quickly reassigned from Forgey to Campbell,&nbsp; who had retired from a district judge post in Laramie County last year. No explanation was offered by the courts for the switch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Campbell’s ruling doesn’t end the case. Instead, it halts enforcement of the laws while the lawsuit proceeds.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-supreme-court-mulls-constitutionality-of-states-abortion-bans/">Wyoming Supreme Court is now weighing arguments</a> in the 2023 abortion bans case. A ruling on that case is expected later this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For as long as Jim Rooks has lived in Jackson Hole, the north end of town has always been eclectic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over his many decades, an odd mix of government buildings, rafting company headquarters, and mom and pop shops have been the first buildings to welcome any visitor driving in from Grand Teton National Park.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s just been kind of a mix match, like a potpourri,” said Rooks, a former history teacher fresh off a four-year term as a town councilor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That era could soon be coming to an end, or at least the more laid-back feel for that stretch of town. Mogul Capital, a Utah-based developer, <a href="https://www.jacksonwy.gov/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=1249">has plans</a> for a mega-sized, multi-use project spanning 11 lots and nearly an entire city block. The project calls for 109 hotel rooms, 17 free-market condos, 16 condos designated for workers, a restaurant, spa and underground parking.&nbsp;</p>

(Jenna McMurtry / KHOL)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Mogul’s project could be the town’s largest private commercial development to date, with original plans calling for a complex four times the size of Jackson’s Target store. The unprecedented scale came as a shock to not just the public, but to the elected officials who placed a 6-month construction moratorium on commercial buildings to study the impacts of large developments.</p>



<p>Though the project has been scaled back, both the public and elected officials have expressed concerns that the designs are still <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/town_county/moguls-revised-plan-faces-more-scrutiny/article_0a97551a-edab-11ef-9480-bf2135191e12.html">overly “heroic” and threaten town character</a>.</p>



<p>Concerns about aesthetics, housing workers and traffic have dominated the discourse so far. But Rooks has long felt that the above-ground focus is a distraction from what he said is a legitimate public health threat that lurks beneath the site itself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Teton Texaco gas station that once fueled up cars on a portion of the site stored gasoline in underground tanks, as is typical for most gas stations. In 1989, it was found that the tanks had leaked, leaving behind a plume of chemicals.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Benzene, a known carcinogen, was one of them. Trace amounts of the chemical was already known to have found its way into <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/benzene-found-again-in-town-water/article_7d896ffd-ba37-5404-9681-ba4856ef6932.html">Jackson’s water wells before</a>, on the other side of town.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-soundcloud wp-block-embed-soundcloud"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Pollution plagues largest development in Jackson Hole history by KHOL" width="780" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F2081344851&#038;show_artwork=true&#038;maxheight=1000&#038;maxwidth=780"></iframe>
</div></figure>



<p>“The environmental aspects of this property are more important than almost any other one in this county because there is a massive benzene plume in the soil right here,” Rooks said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By 1990, the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality had begun remediation on the site, which included removing two 6,000-gallon gasoline tanks, one 500-gallon waste oil tank and one 500-gallon heating oil tank.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The town of Jackson said that much of the contaminant has been “remediated or dissipated,” though oversight for the cleanup has been the sole responsibility of DEQ.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In a town of high-value real estate, the undeveloped lots stand out. In Jackson, people fall into two main camps when it comes to development on top of the plume. For some, development introduces more risks. For others, it could be the solution that brings in private dollars to address a potential public health problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Carlin Girard, executive director of the Teton Conservation District, is with the latter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s not hard to look at a private development that&#8217;s excavating a large area on top of a contaminated site and removing that material as a bad thing,” Girard said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But from another lens, it could be an additional remediation tactic that brings in money for an expensive cleanup.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jackson resident Fred Becker isn’t so sure. For now, nothing can convince him that the site is safe for development unless all of the contaminated groundwater and soil is removed ahead of breaking ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, according to Mogul’s latest plans, that won’t be the case.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The current development plan, based on preliminary feedback from WDEQ, leaves the remaining impacted soil and groundwater at the Teton Texaco site undisturbed by building above grade in this portion of the North Cache property,” Mogul’s Vice President Brent Layton said in an email.&nbsp;</p>

Becker, pictured in the KHOL 89.1 studio, has been outspoken about the project because it sits atop a long-documented benzene plume. (Jenna McMurtry / KHOL)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>In a March 5 letter to the town, Mogul Capital stated that the company was “seeking to avoid excavation in the plume by reducing the subgrade parking and infrastructure.” The project originally called for building two stories underground and has since scaled that back to one.</p>



<p>“Mogul is committed to working in close coordination with [DEQ’s <a href="https://deq.wyoming.gov/2022/04/wyomings-storage-tank-program-leads-the-nation-in-compliance/">Storage Tank Program</a>] and has retained experienced environmental consultants to ensure redevelopment of the North Cache property occurs consistently with environmental requirements,” Layton added.</p>



<p>But Becker, a licensed hydrogeologist and trained environmental engineer, said leaving the benzene in the ground before developing on the land introduces a few risks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Even a crawlspace above a groundwater table, if you have benzene in the groundwater, that vapor comes up out of the water, comes through the soil and it will come through concrete,” Becker said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Becker said a ventilation system must be installed to take care of that risk, something Mogul said it was looking into in its sketch plan.</p>



<p>The cleanup for a site like where Mogul wants to develop is complicated by the area’s high water table, meaning the construction site requires a lot of dewatering.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Containing that contaminant load during all of this [cleanup] is something that I am a little concerned about,” said Girard, who also has a background in water resources management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both Becker and Girard hope to see constant monitoring to make sure that the contaminated soil and groundwater do not enter the stormwater system, regardless of how Mogul ultimately addresses the plume.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Soil cleanup is relatively easy. The easiest and least expensive, if you can do it, is just to dig it out and find a new home for it, which is a hazardous waste landfill,” Becker said.&nbsp;</p>

This marsh sits across the street and a couple of blocks north of the Mogul site. (Jenna McMurtry / KHOL)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Groundwater remediation, however, is much harder, according to Becker, who is also a board member of <a href="https://protectourwaterjh.org/about/#staff">Protect Our Water Jackson Hole</a>, a nonprofit focused on water quality. He’s also concerned that the benzene in the groundwater could contaminate nearby Flat Creek amid the cleanup, which is in the direction the plume is already slowly migrating.</p>



<p>Jackson Mayor Arne Jorgensen doesn’t know how the town or the developer will handle the plume just yet. He anticipates that the town council will require another opinion from a third-party consultant in addition to the geotechnical report Mogul will produce.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until then, it’s hard to say what the plume means for the future of Mogul’s sprawling project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Some may propose that you don&#8217;t disturb it and then you cap it and leave it in place,” Jorgensen said. “Others would suggest that you might want to go in and get rid of the contaminated soils and just get them off-site.”</p>



<p>Regardless, Rooks hopes the town council will hold the developer to a high standard. The council is slated to vote on the developer’s sketch plan during their Monday <a href="https://www.jacksonwy.gov/290/Watch-a-Meeting-Online">evening meeting</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rooks cautioned that though it may be the first project of this scale, it likely won’t be the last. With Jackson having a few other known benzene plumes, it might not even be the only project that involves a cleanup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the behest of <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyomings-soon-to-drop-shed-hunting-rules-set-new-precedent/">state lawmakers</a>, Wyoming in 2024 took unprecedented steps to regulate shed antler hunting — actions that have started <a href="https://www.outdoorlife.com/hunting/idaho-nonresident-shed-hunting-license/">a western trend</a>. Specifically, the Equality State now requires out-of-state residents to get a conservation stamp and to wait a week, giving residents a head start. </p>



<p>Those changes caught <a href="https://wyofile.com/a-montana-shed-hunters-accidental-last-wyoming-dance/">some shed-seeking Westerners off-guard</a>. But the majority of antler seekers are relishing the new rules, wildlife officials now know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“High levels of approval, in and of itself, shows that people were really receptive to the regulation,” said University of California-Berkeley PhD candidate Sam Maher, who’s been <a href="https://wyofile.com/the-typical-wyoming-shed-hunter-who-is-he-and-yes-he-is-a-man/">studying antler hunting in Wyoming since 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Elk-shed-scaled.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A shed hunter sizes up his hand alongside the widest portion of a palmated elk antler in May 2022. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2024, Maher and her collaborators surveyed 318 shed hunters online and in person at trailheads within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, where there’s a seasonal closure on antler gathering until May 1. <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Appendices-Maher-et-al.-2025.pdf">The results suggest</a> that 64% of all respondents were in favor of the new restrictions on non-resident antler gathering. To no surprise, Wyoming residents who stood to benefit were the most on board: 87% favored the new rules, versus just 27% of non-residents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new regulations also motivated more locals to hit the hills. Some 22% of the Wyoming residents that Maher and company surveyed said they “would not have shed hunted otherwise,” but went out because there was the perception of less competition. Non-residents, meanwhile, were effectively dissuaded from coming to Wyoming, even after they could on May 8. Some 29% of those surveyed reported not coming because of the new regulations.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“We asked residents and non-residents how it changed their behavior,” Maher said of the new rules. “It seemed like the increased enthusiasm by residents offset the fact that non-residents couldn&#8217;t come in for the first week.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studying under UC-Berkeley professor and seasonal Wyoming resident Arthur Middleton, Maher has been examining the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/03/14/the-great-american-antler-boom">burgeoning pursuit of antlers</a> in the American West for a chapter in her dissertation. The first batch of data she received after her 2023 surveys provided new insights into the demographic makeup of shed hunters: The majority are<a href="https://wyofile.com/the-typical-wyoming-shed-hunter-who-is-he-and-yes-he-is-a-man/"> white male westerners</a> who like nature and exercise and are not motivated by the <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/valley/feature/elk-fest-cleans-up/article_107283fa-1616-11ef-8f01-a7df65ee1403.html">high dollar that elkhorn can fetch</a>. She’s adapted the results into a user-friendly <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/33efbbbb78ba4a3ca2e0ec871719745f">story map dubbed “Brown Gold Rush.”</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8504_1-e1705075305983.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A shed hunter with a big haul crosses Flat Creek on the Bridger-Teton National Forest adjacent to the National Elk Refuge. (Sam Maher)</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s also a greater goal for the research. Maher and the University of Wyoming’s Tyler Kjorstad are working on an academic paper, <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/maher-et-al-2025.pdf">“The emerging need to manage scavenged wildlife resources,</a>” that’s going through the peer-review process with the Journal of Biological Conservation.</p>



<p>Kjorstad, who’s with UW’s College of Business, is also working with Maher on another paper estimating the economic contribution of shed hunting in Wyoming. All the data they’re amassing, he said, is useful outside of academia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s information that&#8217;s advantageous for policy managers and ecologists, and in my opinion, economists,” Kjorstad told WyoFile.</p>





<p>The steps that Wyoming has taken to regulate shed antler hunting are “a big deal,” Maher said. Those regulations started with seasonal closures back in 2009 to protect wintering wildlife, but have since evolved to protect the experience of shed antler hunting. Antlers fall into a “weird gray area” because, after they separate from an animal, they’re typically not protected from commercial sale, like wild game meat is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The act of regulating this is pretty unprecedented and interesting,” Maher said. It sets the stage, she said, for land and wildlife managers to regulate “similar resources,” naming bird feathers, snake skins and seashells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already, neighboring states are copying Wyoming’s approach to regulating shed hunting. Starting in 2025, for example, <a href="https://www.outdoorlife.com/hunting/idaho-nonresident-shed-hunting-license/">out-of-state shed hunters in Idaho</a> will have to possess a nonresident hunting license — <a href="https://idfg.idaho.gov/licenses/fees-nonresident">a $185 investment</a>. The Montana Legislature also is weighing a bill that proposes a $50 non-resident license fee for shed hunting, <a href="https://projects.montanafreepress.org/capitol-tracker-2025/bills/hb-897/">according to the Montana Free Press</a>’ bill tracker.</p>

<p>HULETT—Jim Neiman says that the best-case scenario for his family’s timber mill at the base of the Bear Lodge Mountains is that it doesn’t shutter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Crook County sawmill in 2022 <a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/natural-resources-energy/2022-07-27/a-black-hills-area-forest-products-company-is-having-to-cut-back-due-to-a-lack-of-timber">shrunk to one shift</a> to survive hard economic times and a dearth of available timber. Three years later, there are what appear to be major industry tailwinds: a <a href="https://wyofile.com/lawmakers-loggers-long-for-trump-driven-revival-of-wyomings-dying-timber-industry/">pro-logging presidential order</a>, <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/lumber-trump-tariffs-canada">prospective tariff hikes</a> on Canadian timber and now a <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/sm-1078-006.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary’s order</a> declaring an “emergency” to stimulate logging on 112.6 million acres of national forest. The order covers nearly 60% of all national forest lands.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Collectively, it stands to help, Neiman said. The timber sale approval process, which is run through the National Environmental Policy Act, is likely to go much faster.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The old process with NEPA could sometimes take a year and a half to five years,” he said. “This will speed that up to a few months.”</p>

</figcaption></figure>



<p>Yet, the businessman and <a href="https://wyofile.com/far-right-lawmakers-prepare-to-wield-their-growing-power/">cousin of the Wyoming Legislature’s speaker of the House</a> is not optimistic that he’ll be returning to two shifts at his Wyoming mill anytime within the foreseeable future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I would hope to maintain one shift in Hulett and two shifts at our Spearfish operation,” Neiman told WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s the optimistic outlook. The alternative is he has to close.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Something’s got to happen fast,” he said, “and it can’t wait three years.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hulett, which houses one of the Equality State’s few remaining large commercial sawmills, is in as good a position as any Wyoming community to benefit from what proponents hope will be a <a href="https://wyofile.com/lawmakers-loggers-long-for-trump-driven-revival-of-wyomings-dying-timber-industry/">Trump-driven revival of a dying timber industry</a>. Yet, industry insiders, watchdog groups and foresters all say that it’s questionable whether another golden era of timber cutting will return to the Black Hills region, or any reach of Wyoming, soon. The infrastructure that would enable such a boom has faded into history, and in its absence prospective large-scale cuts don’t pencil out for large swaths of the state. And there’s likely too much regulatory uncertainty, or not enough accessible timber, to stimulate new mills in the old logging towns, like Afton <a href="https://wyofile.com/a-military-obsession-tank-collection-and-big-influence-on-dubois/">and Dubois</a>, that lost them long ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the Trump administration is attempting to stimulate commercial cutting on national forests all around the country.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Federal directive</strong></h3>



<p>The latest effort comes from Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. An <a href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/sm-1078-006.pdf?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">April 3 secretarial order</a> from the Texas attorney eliminates the “objection” process and requirements to provide a range of options under the National Environmental Policy Act when reviewing different timber cutting projects. The regulatory streamlining applies to the majority of the federal forestland nationwide and in Wyoming. Forestland that got bunched in includes those rated at “very high” or “high” wildfire risk, and areas at risk of “substantially increased tree mortality” in the next 15 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a href="http://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/forest-health-fuels-emergency-lands.pdf">A map</a> accompanies the order. By some measures, it’s crude. The map shows that Rollins’ emergency declaration extends to areas that are unlikely to ever be logged because of other federal laws and designations. Encompassed by the emergency declaration are large swaths of designated wilderness areas and inventoried roadless areas, the map shows.</p>

<p>“Wyoming’s got about two-thirds of its forested lands in roadless and wilderness [areas], and so only a third of the Forest Service lands are probably even accessible to manage,” Wyoming State Forester Kelly Norris told WyoFile. “But there are still a lot of lands to manage.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>From Norris’ perspective, Rollins’ order is the latest in a succession of &#8220;positive changes” in trying to “make timber more accessible.” Via that order, the agriculture secretary also directed the Forest Service to update its guidance to speed up timber sales, “increase certainty in future timber supply” and boost cutting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Forest Service Acting Associate Chief Chris French announced he was acting on that guidance in tandem on April 3, writing <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Implementation-of-Secretarial-Memo-1078-006-1.pdf">in a memo</a> that he’d be completing a national strategy within 30 days. His memo tasks regional foresters with developing five-year strategies aimed at achieving a 25% increase in timber production within two months of the national strategy’s completion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Only time will tell whether that’s an achievable goal within the eight national forests that are partially or fully within Wyoming. But it’ll be “tough,” at least in the view of Bridger-Teton National Forest retiree Andy Norman, a wildfire specialist who has a background in forestry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s economics,” Norman said. “You can say as much as you want, but it&#8217;s still going to be tough.”</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>‘Timber mining’</strong></h3>



<p>Part of the issue is that Wyoming is a substandard state to grow trees. It often takes so long for trees to mature — a century even — that it’s effectively “timber mining.”</p>



<p>“You harvest them,” Norman said, “you&#8217;re not going to come back.”</p>

</figcaption></figure>



<p>The other part of the equation is the scarcity of large commercial sawmills that can enable timber sales to pencil out. Only a few remain, including Neiman Enterprises’ operation in Hulett, a <a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/natural-resources-energy/2013-08-02/new-saw-mill-helps-clear-forests-of-beetle-killed-trees">Saratoga mill</a> that relies on standing dead timber and the South and Jones Timber Company mill in Evanston.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because cut trees have to be shipped to one of those spots or out of state, the cost of diesel and gasoline can have a lot of bearing on the viability of a logging project, Norris said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are subsidized logging efforts underway in parts of Wyoming a long way from a sawmill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Norris pointed to the Dunoir watershed in the Shoshone National Forest, which was designated as a “critical fireshed” during the Biden administration.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Funding was given to do the work,” the state forester said. The National Forest Foundation and Mule Deer Foundation, she said, have also assisted in the project by paying for a <a href="https://www.governmentjobs.com/careers/wyoming/jobs/newprint/4573139">“Good Neighbor Authority” forester position</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>U.S. Forest Service Rocky Mountain Regional Forester Troy Heithecker <a href="https://wyofile.com/lawmakers-loggers-long-for-trump-driven-revival-of-wyomings-dying-timber-industry/">said in early March</a> that the bipartisan <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/471">Fix Our Forests Act</a> could speed up the work in the Dunoir area. The act, which has passed the U.S. House, has been introduced in the Senate and has support <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-04-11/padilla-hopes-fix-our-forests-act-will-prevent-more-la-fires">even from Democratic lawmakers like California Sen. Alex Padilla</a>.</p>



<p>“We’re ready,” Heithecker told state lawmakers at the Legislature’s annual “forest health briefing.” “We have projects lined up as soon as that bill passes.”</p>



<p>In Hulett, Neiman operates out of a region that’s one of the most favorable for modern-day Wyoming logging. The dominant conifer in the Black Hills is the ponderosa, which is faster growing. And there are still mills in close proximity, unlike many of Wyoming’s other national forests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’ve got the sawmill capacity, but we don&#8217;t have the supply of trees,” said Dave Mertz, a retired Black Hills National Forest staffer who’s now a member of a South Dakota public lands stewardship group, the <a href="https://www.norbecksociety.com/">Norbeck Society</a>. “I would say that the Black Hills National Forest is an outlier because of that.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>‘Been through a lot’</strong></h3>



<p>The Black Hills region’s forests, he said, have “been through a lot,” including the mountain pine beetle epidemic and large wildfires around the turn of the century. Overcutting what’s left, he said, is a concern — and partly for the industry’s sake.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Norbeck Society, and pretty much everybody, wants to see a sawmill industry here for the long term,” Mertz said. “We absolutely realize the value of having that, but we think that the surest way to lose them would be overcutting the forest.”</p>



<p>“Eventually,” he added, “there won&#8217;t be enough left there to support them.”</p>

<p>But Neiman simultaneously feels pressure to bring in more timber from the Black Hills National Forest to keep the lights on and his remaining staff employed. Across all his mills, he’s already laid off 200 people in the last five years. At the current rate of timber sales, he’s not going to be able to keep going, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’ve only put 400,000 board feet up,” Neiman said of the current fiscal year. “That won&#8217;t run us a week. That’s unacceptable.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>Neiman spoke from a family restaurant, the 77 Steakhouse and Saloon, located in the clubhouse of a golf course that he built to help diversify the northeastern Wyoming community’s economy. He brought golf to Crook County, along with an airport, after seeing firsthand what happened to Pacific Northwest timber towns when the floor fell out during the spotted owl wars late last century.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Unemployment went to 70%, divorce rates went up, all the social issues just skyrocketed,” Neiman said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hulett’s in a relatively better position if its mill someday becomes a relic. There’s a tourism economy from <a href="https://wyofile.com/devils-tower-national-monument-slashes-hours-without-explanation/">Devil’s Tower National Monument</a> and an active real estate industry capitalizing on ranchland that’s being subdivided. That, however, is yet another challenging dynamic for commercial timber cutting in the Bear Lodge Mountains.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Realtor-sign-1-scaled.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Large ranches being subdivided add another challenge to the timber industry in Northeast Wyoming. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Some of the newcomers don’t allow logging, said Doug Mills, who runs Bearlodge Forest Products, a business that includes a pallet-cutting mill in Hulett. Even when it’s available for cutting, subdivided ranchland doesn’t always make financial sense to log, he said.</p>



<p>“You can&#8217;t just roll in there and take care of a guy&#8217;s 40 acres,” Mills said. “It costs so much to mobilize equipment.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Challenges aside, Mills, like Neiman, is hopeful that the storm of federal policy changes “lifts some of the pressure” and provides some momentum to keep going.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“A lot of the mills are tapering down, or selling off,” Mills said. “Once a business like that … goes away, they don&#8217;t come back very soon.”</p>

<p>With spring comes wedding season, when Cara Rank begins to rent table settings for Jackson Hole occasions with hundreds of guests. She plans ahead, placing orders six to nine months in advance. President Donald Trump’s now-paused tariffs would have slapped a $40,000 import tax on her roughly $200,000 shipment of hand-painted porcelain dinnerware, cutlery and glassware — all coming from Europe in May.</p>



<p>Preparing to absorb that cost on Wednesday morning and fearing a recession, Rank decided not to hire a new full-time position, at a salary of $70,000 with benefits, even though she had a finalist for the job.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Do they want me to put people to work and pay them a living wage or do they want me to pay tariffs?” Rank told WyoFile on Wednesday. “Because that’s the decision in my mind.”</p>



<p>But then Trump soon reversed course, <a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114309144289505174">announcing </a>a 90-day pause on all “reciprocal” tariffs that went into effect at midnight, except for China, which is now facing a triple-digit tariff. (Trump did <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/10/us/politics/trump-tariffs-republicans-congress.html">maintain a 10% tariff rate on most countries</a>.)</p>



<p>“I think the message that was sent to Donald Trump was very clear that the world will not accept these tariffs. What you saw yesterday was him reacting to that,” Rank said. “It’s a roller coaster, you don’t know how to plan for your business because he is so erratic.”</p>

These glasses come from the Czech Republic, which was facing new 20% tariffs until President Donald Trump reversed course Wednesday.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Small businesses from Jackson to Casper are being whipsawed by the Trump administration’s on-again, off-again tariffs on one side and a global trading system that they depend upon to run their businesses on the other. Small businesses accounted for 129,426, or 65.1%, of Wyoming employees, according to a 2024 report by the <a href="https://advocacy.sba.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Wyoming.pdf">U.S. Small Business Administration</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rank owns two Jackson businesses, Objet West by XoWyo, which does event rentals, and XoWyo Paper and Press, which also relies on imported materials to print high-end wedding invitations and other custom stationery. She has 11 employees right now, and that number will jump to 25 during the height of weddings and other summer events.</p>



<p>Rank’s pessimism about the economy Wednesday turned to cautious optimism by Thursday. For now, facing 10% baseline tariffs Trump imposed April 5 on nearly all countries, she might still hire that position and grow her company, she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wyoming businesses are at the mercy of a global trading system that has been decades in the making. One Casper storefront, and its mannequins, has stood watch through the many changes. Dawn Stevenson took ownership of the Mode O’ Day clothing store franchise in downtown Casper in 1974. That same year, Congress passed the <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10384/pdf/COMPS-10384.pdf">Trade Act of 1974</a>, giving the president more authority to negotiate trade deals.</p>



<p>At that time, Casper’s store was one of 840 franchises around the country.<a href="https://oilcity.news/community/city/2019/05/03/fashion-crossroads-has-been-a-downtown-anchor-for-45-years/"> In a 2019 interview with Oil City News,</a> Stevenson said the company eventually rebranded to Fashion Crossroads to stay relevant with changing trends, but went bankrupt in the 1990s. Stevenson bought the brand and kept operating the store.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kyleen Stevenson-Braxton bought the store from her mother, and Fashion Crossroads remains a steady presence today, celebrating <a href="https://oilcity.news/community/business/2024/04/24/fashion-crossroads-to-mark-50-years-of-business-in-downtown-casper/">its 50th anniversary</a> last year. But Stevenson-Braxton now runs a business woven together by global relationships. America’s textile manufacturing industry is almost nonexistent, so stocking a store with American-made goods affordably and consistently isn’t an option.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, Stevenson-Braxton orders a lot of her premium items from Canadian producers, comparing their textile industry to what America’s once offered as far as quality. With her current stock pre-booked with vendors last year, prices are locked in through the fall season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I won’t see price changes until I go to market in August when I’m looking at the spring 2026 season,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her store’s less expensive merchandise comes mainly from China, India and Mexico, and she expects to see those prices rising soon. Although the Trump administration paused higher tariffs for countries like India, the president doubled down on China.</p>



<p>“Based on the lack of respect that China has shown to the World’s Markets, I am hereby raising the Tariff charged to China by the United States of America to 125%, effective immediately,” Trump posted Wednesday on Truth Social. “At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable.” <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/trumps-triple-digit-tariff-essentially-cuts-off-most-trade-with-china-says-economist.html">(The cumulative U.S. rate for Chinese imports is now 145%.)</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>It’s very scary to me honestly as a business owner. Not just the tariffs, but I’m afraid that our economy’s going to get broken.</p><cite>Kyleen Stevenson-Braxton, Owner of Fashion Crossroads</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Closer to home, Stevenson-Braxton is afraid she might have to drop vendors she’s used for decades if they’re forced to price themselves out of the market, particularly those based in Canada.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s very scary to me honestly as a business owner,” she said. “Not just the tariffs, but I’m afraid that our economy’s going to get broken.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the turmoil and uncertainty follows what has already been a tough time for clothing retailers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Small businesses in general – and clothing in particular – we never really recovered from COVID because supply chains were affected and all of the elements that go into making clothing went up [in price]. So thread, buttons, zippers, cloth, all of these commodities went up in price.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She said wholesale and operating costs such as rent and energy have risen as well. “You have a choice: You can either pass it on or you can try and eat it, but we can’t pass on all of these increases, and we can’t just eat all of it.”</p>



<p>There’s only so much her store can absorb before she has to pass costs on to her customers, she said, “and then the customer has a threshold of what they’re willing to spend because they’re dealing with all of the same things.”</p>

<p>Another Casper business, Wyoming Camera Outfitters, carries consumer and professional imaging gear from Canon, Nikon and Sony. They also have extensive offerings of aftermarket lens makers, such as Tamron.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s been chaotic behind the scenes, store manager Chris Luse said Tuesday before Trump reversed course on hefty tariffs for countries like Japan. Most of the equipment the store offers is manufactured in Japan and the Philippines, with some imports from China and other Asian countries.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re getting emails left and right from all of the manufacturers,” he said. He said the first thing they’ll likely see is quick elimination of rebates and incentives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luse thinks the manufacturers will have something of a longer term outlook by the end of this week. “Most of the manufacturers should start having better game plans by then.”&nbsp;</p>





<p>The store has heard from numerous regular customers who are worried about price increases, and they’ve seen a bit of “panic buying” already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rank herself was contemplating rushing purchases on electronics for her business to get ahead of tariff-induced price hikes. While somewhat reassured by Trump’s pause, Rank is still adding up what the 10% baseline tariff will mean for her bottom line. Her business also typically buys packing materials, bags, foam, ink, tape and glue from China.</p>



<p>“What’s going to happen with China? Should I stock up?” Rank pondered Thursday. “Do I want to spend $10,000 on computers today rather than spacing it out over three to four months?”</p>
