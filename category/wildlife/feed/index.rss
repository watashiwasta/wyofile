<p>The majority of visitors to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks value wildlife viewing so much that they would support a park-related fee or tax toward habitat conservation, a new study finds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.70051">“Tradeoffs and win-wins between large landscape conservation and wildlife viewing in protected areas,”</a> was published Sunday in <em>Conservation Science and Practice. </em>Along with establishing support for paying conservation fees, the paper concludes that species population declines could have a greater effect on park visitation than imposing such fees.</p>



<p>“Visitors responded that they would be likely to visit the parks less if there were fewer wildlife to see,” said co-author Hilary Byerly Flint, a researcher with the University of Wyoming’s Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study looked specifically at Wyoming’s two northwestern national parks, and co-authors include Byerly Flint and Drew Bennett with the Haub School; migration researcher Arthur Middleton with the University of California, Berkeley; Leslie Richardson with the National Park Service’s economics program and Aaron Enriquez with the U.S. Geological Survey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authors say the study cements with data what many people already know: Seeing grizzly bears, elk, wolves or other animals in the wild is tremendously valuable to the public. So valuable that most would pony up to support conservation efforts beyond park boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For the vast majority of people who visit the parks, it&#8217;s mind blowing” to see something like an elk bugling, said Scott Christensen, executive director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, which helped fund the study. “It&#8217;s almost a once-in-a-lifetime experience for them, and it has real, tangible value.”</p>

<p>The concept of a conservation fee in national parks is not new, though it has yet to gain required federal traction to be enacted. Authors hope the study can be used to continue the dialogue, Byerly Flint said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we see this really as the start of a conversation about how to pay for conservation in these areas that are increasingly threatened,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re seeing the loss of habitat for these migratory ungulates at unprecedented rates,” Byerly Flint continued. And that leads to the question of: “How to pay for conservation of that habitat, while also maintaining the benefits and the wonderful experiences that park visitors enjoy when they come to Yellowstone and Grand Teton?”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Genesis</strong></h4>



<p>In 2018, former Wyoming State Rep. Al Sommers, a Sublette County rancher, sponsored a <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2018/HJ0005">joint resolution</a> relating to the collection of wildlife conservation fees at Yellowstone and Grand Teton. His resolution requested that the Department of the Interior and National Park Service enter into an agreement with Wyoming to collect a wildlife conservation fee at the parks to generate revenue for conservation efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Legislature passed the resolution, and Gov. Mark Gordon signed it, but those fees have not gained federal approval.</p>



<p>“My priority was conflict resolution,” Sommers told WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whether it’s grizzly bears or wolves, or elk or, frankly, wildlife on highways,” Sommers said, the fee was envisioned as “a way to generate money from all of the public, from the national public that enjoys these wildlife in the park, to help mitigate some of the cost associated with that and to ensure wildlife’s viability.”</p>



<p>Two years later, Middleton co-authored a paper titled <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.335">“Harnessing visitors&#8217; enthusiasm for national parks to fund cooperative large-landscape conservation,”</a> which further explored the concept. That study examined legal and political challenges and estimated that a fee of up to $10 per vehicle could generate up to $13 million annually for conservation projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new study takes the issue a step further, Byerly Flint said, by examining “what park visitors themselves think about the idea of contributing towards conservation and how important the animals that require habitat beyond park boundaries are to park visitor experiences.”</p>



<p>In summer 2022, a research assistant spent two months surveying visitors of Yellowstone and Grand Teton parks — both inside their boundaries and outside in communities like Jackson and Cody. </p>



<p>Researchers analyzed 991 responses. Just over 75% of respondents cited wildlife viewing as a primary reason for their trips to Yellowstone and Grand Teton. The majority also supported the idea of paying extra for conservation —&nbsp;with 93% supportive of a voluntary donation; 75% supportive of a tax or fee on goods and services; and 66% supportive of a mandatory wildlife conservation fee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study also found that wildlife viewing generates an estimated $581 million in annual recreational value in the two national parks, representing a significant economic engine. Yellowstone tallied 4.74 million visitations in 2024 — the second highest year on record. Grand Teton, meanwhile, reported 3.62 million, its third highest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly half of respondents, furthermore, said they would take fewer trips to the parks if there were fewer wide-ranging wildlife to view. That, researchers calculated, could result in about a 15% decrease in overall park visitation.</p>

<p>The results illustrate support for a basic trade off, the study concludes. Visitors are willing to pony up rather than risk long-term wildlife declines. </p>



<p>“These wide-ranging wildlife, like elk and mule deer and grizzly bears, are hugely important to park visitor experiences, to the reasons they decide to visit the parks,” Byerly Flint said.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Sommers’ resolution, along with a similar version passed in Montana, was nonbinding. Any change in park fees falls under the purview of the National Park Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyoming’s park superintendents have indicated support for wildlife, Byerly Flint noted. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly declined to comment for this story; Grand Teton Superintendent Chip Jenkins didn’t respond by publication time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Byerly Flint said, the paper underscores the point that “the value of the experience within the park boundaries is contingent upon what&#8217;s happening outside of park boundaries.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Support for a fee or donation was regardless of income or politics, the report found. In terms of diminishing returns, researchers found that a cost increase of more than $75 would equate to the same reduction in visits that might result from fewer wildlife to view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study does not mean the co-authors are set on fees as a solution, Byerly Flint said. “This is one way. This isn&#8217;t necessarily <em>the way. </em>It&#8217;s just an idea that we&#8217;re exploring.”</p>



<p>Christensen of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition echoed that sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every animal that spends time in the parks also spends time outside of the parks and in these unprotected areas,” he said. “And so our interest in this study is really around trying to come up with some innovative approaches for how to pay for conservation long term. I think what this study tells us, and gives us some hope around, is that people are willing to do that … there’s a willingness there.”</p>

<p>Grassy Wyoming roadsides can be enticing to grizzly bears, especially mothers with cubs, and many people can’t resist stopping to marvel at the charismatic critters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everybody wants to see a bear. That’s the picture you want to take home from your vacation,” said Wyoming Highway Patrol Sgt. Andy Jackson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stopping to view wildlife can be done safely, but in the heat of the moment, the trooper has written tickets to motorists for stopping in the middle of the road, leaving their car doors flung open and standing a hundred yards down the highway to take pictures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I ask them, ‘Would you do this where you live?’ And they go, ‘Well, no,’” Jackson said. “And I go, ‘Well why would you do it here?’”</p>



<p>As bears come out of hibernation, the snow melts and grass greens up along roadsides, Jackson and his colleagues with other local, state and federal agencies are gearing up to attempt to steer humans toward safer habits when it comes to viewing wildlife.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Togwotee Pass tees up a particularly vexing mix of grizzlies, wildlife watchers, steep grades, blind corners, high speeds and troubling behavior. Local, state and federal agencies put out a joint call last week for people to follow “ethical wildlife viewing and photography practices” on Togwotee Pass. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department and U.S. Forest Service have jointly stepped up patrols and are asking the public to heed their directions to minimize traffic jams and ensure safety for humans and bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent Steve Stoinski knows what a hazardous —&nbsp;and sometimes volatile — mix can be found on Togwotee Pass after <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/bye-felicia-hazing-isn-t-popular-or-pretty-but-it-s-keeping-celebrity-grizzly-away/article_17aaec9b-158f-581a-9c68-719053cc3057.html">spending the summer</a> of 2021 trying to solve the problem. Stoinski came out of retirement to work, under contract, for the Fish and Wildlife Service to intensively haze Grizzly 863, also known as Felicia, away from the roadside. Stoinski was already familiar with the grizzlies of Togwotee Pass, having previously investigated reports of drones harassing the federally protected threatened species. Although hazing briefly deterred the mother grizzly, Stoinski saw that it didn’t have a lasting effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The takeaways I had for managing grizzlies near the road,” he told WyoFile, “the bears are just going to hang out on the road.”</p>



<p><strong>Roadside bears</strong></p>



<p>Grizzlies have reasons to be <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/grizzly-399s-death-prompts-study-of-roadside-bear-watching/article_9cb48e1c-b1e8-11ef-921c-6b50d06ebc3c.html">next to the road</a>, whether to forage for food or for their own safety, he said. Male grizzlies tend to stay away from the highway, and female grizzlies tend to avoid male grizzlies to protect their cubs, he said. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/NadplQvQ/img_0688-2.mov"></video></figure>



<p>“I only saw one boar griz that whole summer,” Stoinski recalled. “At that time, Felicia, Bear 863, she headed out of that area as soon as she got wind of that bear and bolted across the highway. We had to stop traffic to get her across the highway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wildlife managers no longer have Bear 863 marked, according to Game and Fish Large Carnivore Supervisor Dan Thompson. Out of an abundance of caution, Thompson didn’t want to say for certain whether the sow and two cubs frequenting the Togwotee Pass area this spring are Felicia and her offspring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over the years, we’ve started to wonder if 863 has turned into a different bear that just likes the road,” Thompson told WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, there’s a sow with two cubs that frequents the area. Game and Fish caught and marked one of the cubs last summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We definitely have a bear that is very observable, and it’s unfortunate we have to go back every year and remind everybody [of] etiquette and ethics when it comes to viewing them,” Thompson said.&nbsp;</p>

Never approach bears. People should maintain a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife. (Jason Wilmot/U.S. Forest Service)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Ethical, and legal, viewing practices include not approaching bears, maintaining 100 yards between yourself and a bear, stopping in paved pullouts — not on the shoulder — and not feeding wildlife. Though Wyoming Highway Patrol typically responds to traffic complaints, they also get called to Togwotee Pass for confrontations over bear viewing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At times, some of the Game and Fish, some of the biologists, get harassed by the people that are bear watching,” Trooper Jackson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already this spring, Thompson said, “we’ve had some pretty nasty confrontations from some members of the public, basically telling us we can’t tell them what to do.”</p>



<p><strong>Human nature&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Those tensions motivated multiple agencies to come together to ask the public to follow directions from law enforcement and wildlife managers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stoinski also got an earful from bear watchers and photographers in 2021 when he hazed bears away from the road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They were pretty belligerent,” Stoinski <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/bye-felicia-hazing-isn-t-popular-or-pretty-but-it-s-keeping-celebrity-grizzly-away/article_17aaec9b-158f-581a-9c68-719053cc3057.html">said at the time</a>. “They got in our faces, were poking me in the chest.”</p>



<p>But eventually, they overcame those initial conflicts and worked together to promote bear and human safety, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bridger-Teton National Forest is leaning heavily into <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/r04/bridger-teton/newsroom/releases/agencies-call-upon-public-help-keep-bears-wild-and-people-safe">education and cooperation</a> to improve safety for bears and people on the highway, which is a <a href="https://dot.state.wy.us/files/live/sites/wydot/files/shared/Planning/Centennial%20Scenic%20Byway.pdf">designated scenic byway</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the <a href="https://bearwisejh.org/">Bear Wise Jackson Hole program</a> and other agency partners, the national forest is asking “the public, photographers, and wildlife tour groups to lead by example.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We get that there’s a lot of opportunities to see wildlife all over the forest,” Bridger-Teton spokeswoman Mary Cernicek said. As new vegetation sprouts along roadsides, attracting bears, “we’re so excited to see them and probably having unintended consequences.”</p>

(Bridger-Teton National Forest)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Originally, Togwotee didn’t see a heavy management presence along the highway, but as bear jams escalated, wildlife managers responded with attempts to change both bear and human behavior. Game and Fish still hazes grizzlies, when possible, away from the Togwotee highway.</p>



<p>“It’s been an ongoing effort to try to keep something worse from happening,” Thompson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it is Felicia along the road, she has been <a href="https://buckrail.com/explainer-what-to-do-in-the-event-of-a-wildlife-vehicle-collision-2/">hit by a car</a> before, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last fall, world-famous Grizzly 399 was <a href="https://wyofile.com/authorities-driver-hit-grizzly-399-while-going-speed-limit-killing-famous-bear-almost-instantly/">fatally struck</a> by a vehicle on the highway through the Snake River Canyon south of Jackson. The <a href="https://wyofile.com/grizzly-bear-399-struck-killed-by-vehicle-south-of-jackson/">matriarch bruin</a> had raised her cubs roadside in Grand Teton National Park for nearly two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Visitors save up and come from around the world to see Wyoming wildlife — a phenomenon not limited to national parks.</p>



<p><strong>Striking a balance&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In Wyoming, it’s illegal to park on the shoulder of a highway unless it’s an emergency, Trooper Jackson said, and people are supposed to use designated pullouts. But enforcing that law isn’t so easy.</p>



<p>He points to the hamlet of Wilson at the base of Teton Pass, where a moose can be seen most summer days from the shoulder of Highway 22.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All summer long, we get people stopping, taking a picture of the moose in Fish Creek,” Jackson said. Wyoming Highway Patrol fields frequent complaints from people who want the cars out of there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And I’m going, ‘These people came 2,000 miles to see this,’” Jackson said. “We try to have a good balance of what’s common sense.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Teton County Sheriff’s Office also enforces traffic laws and gets called to help out on Togwotee Pass. Sheriff Matt Carr said the county used to offer overtime pay to a deputy who lived in nearby Buffalo Valley to patrol the area more frequently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The key problem is people stopping,” Carr said. “It’s really not the tourists as much as it is the professional photographers.”</p>



<p>Carr said he no longer has that deputy or the budget to help as much as the county has in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re trying to watch budgets very seriously this year with the revenue losses we’re seeing from <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/town_county/facing-6-million-deficit-state-cuts-teton-county-mulls-increasing-property-taxes/article_244684e8-eec0-440d-9cc8-ffcffddb302d.html">property tax reductions</a>,” Carr said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Grizzly speed limit?</strong></p>



<p>Looking back on his summer managing the mayhem in 2021, Stoinski sees human nature as a major driver of behavior that can’t be overlooked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People coming from across the country to visit the parks, or to visit Wyoming, and they see a grizzly bear for the first time in their lives, they just can&#8217;t help but stop,” Stoinski said. “There&#8217;s got to be a balance between letting people enjoy the bears while they&#8217;re near the road without getting too close.”</p>



<p>One thing that authorities can control is the speed limit. For his part, Stoinski would like to see variable speed limits deployed when grizzlies are in the area and bear jams become unavoidable.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit.&#8221;</p><cite>Steve Stoinski, retired USFWS Special agent </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Wyoming has variable speed limits for blizzards along the interstate, he noted. Why not take the concept for a test drive along Togwotee?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit, you know when the bears are around the highway,” he said. “Slow traffic down just for people’s safety.”</p>



<p>Already, electronic signs posted along the highway tell people not to stop on the road to view bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://jhwildlife.org/">Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation</a> Executive Director Renee Seidler encourages wildlife enthusiasts to find safer spots to view bears.</p>



<p>“The biggest issue is the road, the traffic, the speed and very little capacity to manage the crowds,” Seidler said, compared to nearby wildlife viewing hot spots in Teton Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seidler also said the agencies might not have yet found the right mix of “carrot and stick.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a recurring problem that I would love to see fixed,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CODY—Two days of discussion about the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population passed before anyone inquired about the status of the species the meeting was focused on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under <a href="https://wyofile.com/judge-gives-feds-45-days-to-decide-on-yellowstone-grizzly-bears-threatened-status/">a court order</a> in January, the Biden administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="https://wyofile.com/feds-yellowstone-lower-48-grizzlies-to-remain-protected-by-endangered-species-act/">proposed continuing with Endangered Species Act protections</a> in the Yellowstone region and all other portions of the Lower 48 where grizzlies reside. Shortly thereafter, pro-delisting leadership was installed by the Trump administration: <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/trumps-interior-pick-backs-grizzly-delisting/article_c3196be2-d45f-11ef-9f85-0bd6e149c5bf.html">Interior Secretary Doug Burgum</a> and Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director who’s now <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-taps-former-wyoming-game-and-fish-chief-nesvik-to-lead-u-s-fish-and-wildlife-service/">nominated</a> to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For months, there’s been little official word about what’s going on with Fish and Wildlife’s proposal, though the agency <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-administration-delays-deadline-for-feedback-on-federal-protection-for-grizzlies/">delayed the deadline</a> for the public to provide feedback. In Cody this week, the topic was barely broached at the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s semi-annual Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee meeting. It only came up because a member of the public, local resident Dewey Vanderhoff, asked “where we’re at in the overall picture with delisting” during the meeting’s closing minutes.</p>

<p>Hilary Cooley, Fish and Wildlife&#8217;s grizzly bear recovery coordinator, pointed out the proposal on the table — and said she couldn’t say much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As far as what happens with that proposal, we’re waiting for leadership to be installed,” Cooley said. “Acting leadership is not interested in making decisions right now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of Friday, 27 pending nominees appeared above Nesvik on the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nom_cal_civ.htm">U.S. Senate’s Executive Calendar</a>, which suggests the wait could drag on. The Trump administration also <a href="https://wyofile.com/muley-fanatics-founder-josh-coursey-tapped-by-trump-for-high-fish-and-wildlife-service-post/">appointed another Wyomingite — mule deer advocate Josh Coursey</a> — to a high Fish and Wildlife Service post, albeit one that doesn’t require Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if expected Fish and Wildlife Service leaders don’t attempt to pull back the existing continued-listing proposal administratively, legislative efforts are underway to delist grizzly bears, <a href="https://wyofile.com/in-new-leadership-post-hageman-takes-fresh-aim-at-federal-land-grizzly-policies/">including from Rep. Harriet Hageman</a>.</p>





<p>The gathering of Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear managers in Cody differed from typical meetings because of the turmoil and turnover the Trump administration has brought to the federal government via its Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Most federal members of the committee attended remotely due to travel and spending restrictions. There were also new faces, goodbyes and discussion about what the <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-and-musks-doge-functionally-destroying-historic-yellowstone-grizzly-science-team/">diminished Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team</a> can realistically accomplish going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One way or another, the USGS is not going to have the resources they&#8217;ve had in the past,” Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Administrator Ken McDonald told the group. “At the November meeting, we better have a plan for the following spring.”</p>



<p>Biologist Matt Gould, the study team’s new leader, told the group that, despite changes in capacity, the committee’s science arm will continue with grizzly monitoring, data collection and <a href="https://wyofile.com/the-new-way-biologists-count-yellowstone-region-grizzly-bears-explained/">administering the new population model</a> to assess bear numbers — last estimated at 1,050 in the ecosystem’s core.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Cody meeting was the last as a full-time employee for <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-and-musks-doge-functionally-destroying-historic-yellowstone-grizzly-science-team/">Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team</a> Leader Frank van Manen. The longtime federal biologist <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-and-musks-doge-functionally-destroying-historic-yellowstone-grizzly-science-team/">retired earlier than expected</a>, though he is staying involved in an emeritus role. He helmed the group for 13 years.</p>



<p>“I know there are some challenges ahead, but keep up the good fight,” van Manen told the group. “This endeavor has been successful for 50 years, for a good reason: Agencies working together.”</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a big old-fashioned horse race,” Hunter Whitney said as he lounged in his makeshift camp Wednesday at the Teton County Fairgrounds, waiting for the opening of shed-antler hunting season.</p>



<p>Camp stoves, backpacks, folding chairs and even a cornhole set surrounded the Star Valley resident as he catnapped among picnic tables at his sidewalk quarters. A long-cold fried egg lay abandoned in a skillet, a pair of sturdy boots aired out on the concrete.</p>



<p>Through a lottery arranged by the Jackson Police Department, Whitney won a coveted spot close to the front of the &#8220;Shed Hunt Motorcade.&#8221; The hundreds of police-escorted pickups and horse trailers would snake through town to be turned loose on nearby public land at 6 a.m. Thursday. That’s the official Wyoming Game and Fish Department time when antler hunting starts and big game winter range opens in the western and southwestern parts of the state.</p>

<p>Male elk shed hundreds of antlers in the spring, dropping some of them on national forest land beyond the National Elk Refuge — home to some 7,000 elk each winter. The refuge itself is closed to antler gathering except for the local Boy Scout troop, which collects them for an annual auction.</p>



<p>Last year, bidders paid an average of more than $26 a pound. A skull and antlers from a winter-kill elk can bring thousands of dollars, depending on size and condition.</p>



<p>The lottery and motorcade replaced the mayhem of various helter-skelter mass starts that marked iterations of the antler rush in years past.</p>



<p>Mike Jackson, No. 265, drove up from Lyman for his first-ever hunt. He and his family arrived at a prescribed time to park in their place in line.</p>

<p>For a day and a night, the fairgrounds became a community of campers with a common goal. For $20 a head, they could corral their mounts in various nearby rodeo pens.</p>



<p>The Jacksons were going to a restaurant before cozying up in their horse trailer to sleep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They planned to get up at 5 a.m., saddle their steeds, load them in the trailer and join the 5:45 a.m. procession to the city limits and open range beyond.</p>



<p>The lottery drew 513 applications, each costing $20, for a designated motorcade spot. By Wednesday afternoon, some 400 vehicles had lined up along Snow King Avenue in a queue that snaked into and around the fairgrounds.</p>





<p>Dubois resident Ty Finley drew No. 2. He was pleased. The No. 1 pickup ahead of him towed a horse trailer that carried only ATVs. Those aren’t allowed off dirt roads, so Finley was pretty sure he would be leading the charge.</p>



<p>After drawing his coveted spot, “I was trying to make sure none of my friends found out about it,” he joked. In fact, he showed up with many friends — Boedeckers, Hankinns, Cragoes, Hadleys and Eastburns — seemingly half the town of Dubois.</p>

<p>"Bringing the buffalo back is about our relationship with them, not domination over them," said Jason Baldes, executive director of the Wind River Buffalo Initiative.</p>

<p class="has-drop-cap">Jason Baldes drove down a dusty, sagebrush highway earlier this month, pulling 11 young buffalo in a trailer up from Colorado to the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming. His blue truck has painted on the side a drawing of buffalo and a calf. As the executive director of the <a href="https://windriverbuffalo.org/">Wind River Tribal Buffalo Initiative</a> and an Eastern Shoshone tribal member, he’s helped grow the number of buffalo on the reservation for the last decade. The latest count: the Northern Arapaho tribe has 97 and the Eastern Shoshone has 118.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Tribes have an important role in restoring buffalo for food sovereignty, culture and nutrition, but also for overall bison recovery,” he said.</p>



<p>The Eastern Shoshone this month voted to classify buffalo as wildlife instead of livestock as a way to treat them more like elk or deer rather than like cattle. Because the two tribes share the same land base, the Northern Arapaho are expected to vote on the distinction as well. The vote indicates a growing interest to both restore buffalo on the landscape and challenge the relationship between animal and product.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While climate change isn’t the main driver behind the push to restore buffalo’s wildlife status, the move could bring positive effects to the fight against global warming. Climate change is shrinking Wyoming’s glaciers, contributing to drought and increasing wildfires. Like cows, buffalo emit methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, by belching, though <a href="https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/18/961/2021/">it’s not clear</a> if buffalo give off the same levels.</p>



<p>While buffalo can contribute to climate change, what they bring in increased <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20231102-why-grazing-bisoncould-be-good-for-the-planet">biodiversity</a> can promote drought resistance and some buffalo herds have been shown to help <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/article/2024/may/15/bison-romania-tarcu-2m-cars-carbon-dioxide-emissions-aoe#:~:text=Prof%20Oswald%20Schmitz%20of%20the,to%20enrich%20the%20ecosystem%2C%20and">store carbon</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The scale of cattle on the landscape and how they are managed contribute to climate change. Baldes argues buffalo should be able to roam on the plains to bolster biodiversity and restore the ecological health of the landscape — but that has to come with a change in relationship.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Buffalo as wildlife allows the animals to exist on the landscape,” Baldes said. “Rather than livestock based on economic and Western paradigms.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wildlife is broadly defined as all living organisms, like plants and animals, that exist outside the direct control of humans. When it comes to how different states define wildlife, the definition can vary. But a good rule of thumb is animals that are not domesticated — as in selectively bred for human consumption or companionship — are typically classified as wildlife.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bison have a complex history since their near extinction over 100 years ago,” said Lisa Shipley, a professor at Washington State University who studies management of wild ungulates, which are large mammals with hooves that include buffalo. Tribes and locals tend to say buffalo while scientists use bison to describe the animal.</p>



<p>During the western expansion of settlers, a combination of overhunting, habitat destruction and government policy aimed at <a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/55-7/indigenous-affairs-hunting-treaty-rights-bison-and-the-countrys-most-controversial-hunt/">killing Indigenous peoples&#8217; food supplies</a> eradicated the animal from the landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Around <a href="https://news.emory.edu/stories/2023/08/esc_bison_impact_24-08-2023/story.html">eight million buffalo</a> were in the United States in 1870 and then in the span of 20 years, there were fewer than 500. Today, in North America, there are roughly <a href="https://www.nwf.org/Educational-Resources/Wildlife-Guide/Mammals/American-Bison#:~:text=There%20are%20two%20bison%20subspecies,to%20uncover%20vegetation%20to%20eat.">20,000 wild plains bison</a> — like the ones Baldes works to put on the Wind River. But most buffalo reside in privately owned operations, where many buffalo are raised for the <a href="https://ambrook.com/research/supply-chain/bison-vs-beef">growing bison meat industry</a>. In 2023, around 85,000 bison were processed for meat consumption in the United States, compared to the 36 million head of cattle. It’s not a lot compared to cattle, but some producers see buffalo as an interesting new addition to the global meat market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The numbers are similar for other kinds of wildlife — there are typically more livestock on the land than wildlife. According to one study, if all the livestock of the world were weighed, the livestock would be 30 times <a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2204892120">heavier</a> than the weight of all the wildlife on Earth.</p>



<p>Reducing the world’s collective reliance on cows — a popular variety of livestock — has been a way many see as a path forward to combating climate change. Eating less beef and dairy products can be good for the planet; cows account for around <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/quitting-cows-could-have-big-environmental-impacts-but-its-harder-than-it-sounds/">10% of greenhouse gas emissions</a>.&nbsp; And having too many cows on a small patch of pasture can <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2024/study-finds-lands-grazing-can-worsen-help-climate-change-0315">negatively affect the environment</a> by causing soil erosion and affecting the amount of carbon the land can absorb.</p>

Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Buffalo tend to move around if given enough room to roam. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1550742413500716#:~:text=Bison%20and%20cattle%20differed%20in,and%20increased%20time%20at%20water.">One study</a> saw that cattle spent half their time grazing, while buffalo only around a quarter of the time — buffalo even moved faster and had an affinity for more varieties of grasses to munch on. But even buffalo can damage the landscape if they are managed like cattle.</p>



<p>“Too many animals on the landscape can lead to rangeland degradation and health concerns,” said Justin Binfet, wildlife management coordinator for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department. The state has classified buffalo as both livestock and wildlife, which means they can be privately owned or managed in conservation herds. However, different places in the state have different rules regarding the animal. Currently, Wyoming issues around 70 buffalo hunting tags a year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The National Park Service manages the oldest untouched population of buffalo in Yellowstone National Park, which intersects with both Wyoming and Montana. <a href="https://montanafreepress.org/2024/12/31/montana-sues-yellowstone-national-park-over-bison-management-plan/#:~:text=Yellowstone%20National%20Park%20plan%20sets,cattle%20transmission%20of%20the%20disease.">Montana has sued the Park Service over their buffalo management plan</a>, citing potential negative effects as the park grows the herd and an interest in letting the buffalo push the boundaries in the park like other wildlife do. The Montana Stockgrowers Association — a group that advocates for the sale of beef — <a href="https://mtbeef.org/montana-stockgrowers-submits-comments-on-ynp-bison-management-plan-draft-eis/">said the Yellowstone management plan</a> for buffalo “did not adequately represent all management options that should be considered,” like more population control and increased tribal hunting.</p>





<p>Ranchers in Wyoming and Montana, including tribal members who raise cattle, often cite the disease brucellosis as a reason to keep buffalo and cattle strictly away from each other. The management plan for buffalo says that there has not been a recorded case of bison-to-cattle transmission.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyoming has a history of contesting tribal hunting rights. In the 2019 United States Supreme Court Case <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/2018/17-532">Herrera v. Wyoming</a>, the court ruled in favor of treaty-protected hunting rights within the state. But how this history will intersect with buffalo’s classification as wildlife remains to be seen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the Wind River Reservation, the tribes have control of wildlife management and hunting regulations. The choice to designate buffalo as wildlife is a matter of tribal sovereignty, tribes making decisions on their homelands.</p>



<p>For Baldes, he wants to eventually hunt buffalo like someone would any other wildlife. He’s in the process of buying property to allow buffalo to roam like they did before Western expansion. He doesn’t like it when people call the Wind River Buffalo Initiative a &#8220;ranch,&#8221; because it has too much of an association with cows and cattle. He says buffalo should be treated like they were before settler contact.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Bringing the buffalo back is about our relationship with them, not domination over them,” Baldes said.</p>

<p>The nation&#8217;s 573 national wildlife refuges are at risk and not a single refuge has the resources it requires, according to a recent U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service inventory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Put together, the National Wildlife Refuge System encompasses 96 million acres, an area larger than Montana, and includes everything from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge&#8217;s 19 million acres in Alaska to the diminutive <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/bamforth">Bamforth National Wildlife Refuge</a> — a springtime pitstop for migrating waterfowl — on Wyoming’s Laramie Plains. Created<a href="https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wildlife-refuge-system/about-us"> 122 years ago under President Theodore Roosevelt, </a>the system now lacks the workforce and other resources necessary to fulfill its mission — “to administer a national network of lands and waters for the conservation, management and, where appropriate, restoration of the fish, wildlife and plant resources and their habitats within the United States for the benefit of present and future generations of Americans” — National Wildlife Refuge System Chief Cynthia Martinez shared on Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Capacity right now is at a tipping point that puts both the economic and the conservation vitality of the National Wildlife Refuge System at risk,” Martinez told members of a call hosted by the National Wildlife Refuge Association.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The inventory, Martinez explained, sorted all 573 refuges into four categories. The first group of refuges was those that have “full required resources” — units that have adequate staff and funding to “fully achieve administration, management and mission goals and objectives” and provide public uses.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We acknowledge that we have no units or field stations that currently meet this standard,” Martinez said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Meanwhile, 57% of national refuges fall into the second category, defined as having “limited resources” and operating with “a portion of the required staff and funding.” These units can only “partially achieve goals,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This is where we begin to see limited visitor center hours and stations heavily supported by volunteers,” Martinez said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The third category of wildlife refuges are those with “insufficient resources.” Some 35% of the agency’s properties fall in this camp, and they “lack sufficient staff and funding” needed to achieve their goals and receive “little or no maintenance or management.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Clouds-over-Pathfinder-July-2019-DBleizeffer.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Clouds threaten rain over Pathfinder Reservoir, July 2019.

<p>A fourth and final category of refuges, 8% of all sites, are those agency leadership considers “shuttered.” The classification means that the federal properties lack “staff and funding necessary to achieve any goals,” Martinez said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Shutter doesn&#8217;t mean that the refuge isn&#8217;t still providing some level of habitat for species,” she said, “but it is just not receiving the staff or the funding that&#8217;s necessary to achieve [its] goals.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martinez&#8217;s hour-long briefing with advocates, former staff and “friends groups” that support the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service was carefully apolitical. She never named President Donald Trump or Elon Musk, the billionaire leading the Department of Government Efficiency, which has been <a href="https://wyofile.com/valentines-day-massacre-uncounted-throng-of-wyomingites-fired-by-trump-administration/">gutting federal workforces</a> and exacerbating conditions for refuges and other federal lands in Wyoming and around the country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re still at the beginning of a new administration,” Martinez said. “We&#8217;re going to be getting more direction on our priorities of this administration as our new director is voted in.”&nbsp;</p>

(Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)<br></figcaption></figure>



<p>The likely incoming director is Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director who’s cleared his <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/local/nesvik-narrowly-passes-first-vote-to-lead-fish-and-wildlife-service/article_cdcaae66-831a-4abd-8a2f-f9563b987fe1.html">first two hurdles</a> in the U.S. Senate confirmation process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He has identified refuges as one of his top five priorities for the Fish and Wildlife Service,” Martinez said. “I&#8217;m expecting that we&#8217;ll see Brian sometime, hopefully in early, mid-May.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>If confirmed, Nesvik will be joined by Josh Coursey, a southwestern Wyoming big game hunting advocate who <a href="https://wyofile.com/muley-fanatics-founder-josh-coursey-tapped-by-trump-for-high-fish-and-wildlife-service-post/">just announced an appointment</a> to the Fish and Wildlife Service.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What about Wyoming’s refuges?&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Although Martinez outlined the status of the National Wildlife Refuge System’s properties in broad strokes, the status of individual refuges remains undisclosed to the public. The list detailing which refuges fall into each category has not seen daylight, according to Desiree Sorenson-Groves, president of the National Wildlife Refuge Association.</p>



<p>“There is no way that&#8217;s getting leaked out until I&#8217;m sure Brian [Nesvik] has a chance to get in and see it,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WyoFile was unable to ascertain which categories Wyoming’s seven federally managed refuges have been assigned to. Agency employees reported that they were unauthorized to talk with the media about the topic.</p>



<p>Wyoming’s refuges include: the 1,166-non-contiguous-acre <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/bamforth">Bamforth National Wildlife Refuge</a> on the Laramie Plains; the 1,968-acre <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/cokeville-meadows/about-us">Cokeville Meadows National Wildlife Refuge</a> along the Bear River; the 1,928-acre <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/hutton-lake/about-us">Hutton Lake National Wildlife Refuge</a> on the Laramie Plains; the 1,968-acre <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/mortenson-lake">Mortenson Lake National Wildlife Refuge</a> on the Laramie Plains; the 24,700-acre <a href="https://wyofile.com/natl-refuge-tries-to-wean-its-elk-off-feed-and-fails-so-far/">National Elk Refuge</a> in Jackson Hole; the 16,807-acre <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/pathfinder">Pathfinder National Wildlife Refuge</a> surrounding the reservoir; and the 26,210-acre <a href="https://www.fws.gov/refuge/seedskadee">Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge</a> that winds along the Green River. (Refuges located on the Laramie Plains are included in the Service’s <a href="https://wyofile.com/feds-buy-2-million-parcel-to-save-wyoming-toad-warts-and-all/">new Wyoming Toad Conservation Area</a> — a complex that provides habitat for the endangered amphibian.)</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/toadsignhorizontal.png?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">On June 18, 2024, the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service gathered with partners and stakeholders to celebrate the establishment of the Wyoming Toad Conservation Area.

<p>WyoFile was unable to file an interview request with the Fish and Wildlife Service’s Mountain-Prairie Region, which includes Wyoming and seven other states. Its regional communications team has been eliminated and contact information has been <a href="https://www.fws.gov/program/mountain-prairie-office-communications">scrubbed from its website</a>. Most if not all 12 members of the team accepted a recent buyout offer — the second round of the Deferred Resignation Program — in anticipation of an upcoming “reduction in force,” according to a federal employee familiar with the situation. WyoFile is granting the person anonymity for fear of retaliation.</p>



<p>Part of the reason the entire regional communications team took the buyout is because Interior Secretary Doug Burgum has signaled in <a href="https://www.doi.gov//document-library/secretary-order/so-3429-consolidation-unification-and-optimization-administrative">a secretarial order</a> that he’s consolidating communications teams throughout his department and dedicated Fish and Wildlife Service teams will cease to exist.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other programs within the agency are also being eliminated, according to the source. Earlier this week, members of <a href="https://www.fws.gov/program/science-applications">Fish and Wildlife’s “Science Applications” program</a> showed up to work and were told to go home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They were told the program is being dissolved — I would guess it&#8217;s because of the climate work — but they don&#8217;t really tell us why,” the source told WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the wake of the second round of buyouts, the Fish and Wildlife Service as a whole is “pretty gutted,” according to the source.</p>



<p>“Moving ahead with even more cuts, I can&#8217;t imagine,” the employee said. “It&#8217;s going to be incredibly difficult to function.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Lander-FWS-office.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&#8217;s Lander field office, pictured here in June 2024, is among the seven federal facilities in Wyoming being eliminated by the Elon-Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)&nbsp;</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Wyoming, cuts have affected many different Fish and Wildlife Service programs: There are <a href="https://wyofile.com/musks-doge-to-eliminate-fish-and-wildlifes-tribal-lander-office-usgs-cheyenne-water-science-station/">plans to close the agency’s tribal office in Lander</a>, a hollowing out of the staff of <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-cuts-may-cost-a-trout-brooding-wyoming-toad-rearing-federal-hatchery-its-entire-staff/">the Saratoga National Fish Hatchery</a> and <a href="https://wyofile.com/a-source-of-wyoming-pride-black-footed-ferret-recovery-hamstrung-by-musks-doge/">blows to black-footed ferret recovery</a> programs. The lack of communications and publicly available information makes it difficult to know if any other programs have been impacted.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>In shambles across the agency</strong></h3>



<p>During the National Wildlife Refuge Association call, one attendee asked Martinez about overall reductions in the workforce during the first three months of the Trump administration. Until the second round of buyouts are processed and contracts are signed, “we’re not going to know the true number,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But Sorenson-Groves, the association president, has come up with some ballpark numbers for the National Wildlife Refuge System portion of the agency. At the end of 2024, she said, there were roughly 2,350 employees. Although the system manages more acreage than the National Park Service, she pointed out, its workforce was only about a tenth of the size.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/GreenRiverSeedskadee-1000-1.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Green River, a major tributary of the Colorado River, flows through Seedskadee National Wildlife Refuge. (Katie Theule/USFWS Mountain-Prairie/FlickrCC)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The cuts, she said, are expected to reduce the workforce down to 1,800-1,900 by the end of May — when people who are taking early retirements will leave.</p>



<p>“The refuge system will have lost at least 20% of their staff, and it could be more,” Sorenson-Groves told WyoFile. “Other agencies, they&#8217;re dealing with that too — like the Forest Service or the BLM or the Park Service, but the refuge system was in a different place already.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wildlife refuges, she said, haven&#8217;t been prioritized by Congress or presidential administrations of either party for the last 15 years. During that period, the system lost 30% of its staff, while public visitation throughout the system climbed by 50%.</p>



<p>“People have found refuges and discovered them, which I think is wonderful, but they don&#8217;t have the capacity,” Sorenson-Groves said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not just the rank-and-file biologists and workers being hemorrhaged.&nbsp;</p>





<p>A third of Fish and Wildlife&#8217;s regional directors have quit, according to the federal employee who WyoFile is granting anonymity. In the Southwest Region, only two of eight members of the leadership team are still on the job, the source said, and the communications leadership and headquarters office are “pretty much wiped out.”</p>



<p>The loss of leadership is an especially painful blow, Sorenson-Groves said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Those are people who have the institutional knowledge and, frankly, the political acumen to work through really complicated issues, whether it&#8217;s water or mineral extraction or habitat in highly urbanized areas,” she said. “These are complicated issues. And they&#8217;re all leaving.”</p>

<p>Bryan Bedrosian’s best guess is that the bird was out on the hunt.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One thing for certain is that the northern goshawk, perched in a Pinedale aspen, wasn’t in its standard habitat. Goshawks, the largest of North America’s three accipiters — acrobatic bird-eating specialists — typically dwell in the forest. Yet this hawk, an adult male based on its pale plumage and thin vertical chest stripes, was in a town surrounded by the sagebrush-dominated high desert.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bedrosian, an avian biologist who works as the Teton Raptor Center’s conservation director, has seen this behavior before.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We had 16 goshawks with transmitters here in [Jackson Hole] over the years,” he said. “The bird that was <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/rare-goshawk-pair-nestles-in-where-snow-king-wants-to-expand/article_487d39c2-689c-53b3-a010-9752294a1575.html">nesting up near Snow King</a>, that bird hung out in town a lot foraging. I suspect collared doves, the more urban birds it was picking off.”</p>





<p>The male goshawk in Pinedale was probably doing the same, Bedrosian said. Females tend to stick tighter to nest sites in treed areas, but males will roam much wider in search of a feathered or furred meal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And for goshawks, coming out of the forested mountains down into the sagebrush sea wouldn’t be completely unheard of. The Wyoming Game and Fish Department, which <a href="https://wgfd.wyo.gov/media/1372/download?inline">classifies goshawks as a “species of greatest conservation need,”</a> reports that in winter the accipiters are known to use “non-forested, open habitats such as shrublands.”&nbsp;</p>

</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although he may have been hunting, no birds were harmed during the half hour or so the goshawk perched in a backyard aspen tree on the afternoon of April 7. A handful of crows hung tight most of that time, “mobbing” the raptor with little effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When goshawks do decide to strike, it’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7XQUzBKq1E&amp;t=299s&amp;ab_channel=WildAmericaAnimalChannel">sight to be seen</a> — the nickname “flying mountain lion” has <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/rare-goshawk-pair-nestles-in-where-snow-king-wants-to-expand/article_487d39c2-689c-53b3-a010-9752294a1575.html">even been thrown around</a>. Goshawks primarily prey on grouse and squirrels, Bedrosian said. They’re territorial, aggressive and even known to give unsuspecting humans a love tap with their talons.</p>



<p>“I’ve gotten tagged,” Bedrosian said. “Climbing up a nest tree, getting hit by the female and drawing blood on the back of my head.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>A southwestern Wyoming big game hunting advocate who spent the past 13 years safeguarding <a href="https://wyofile.com/how-to-decimate-a-mule-deer-herd-a-case-study-in-wyoming/">beleaguered mule deer</a> has been appointed to a high position in the Trump administration’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Josh Coursey, the co-founder and longtime president of the Muley Fanatic Foundation, announced to the group’s membership on Wednesday that he’ll be assuming his new post in May. Coursey did not disclose the nature of the position and reiterated to WyoFile that he was not yet at liberty to say.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a presidential appointment,” Coursey told WyoFile. The position, he added, does not need to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his departure note, Coursey said he felt “called to serve” and is eager for the new challenge.</p>



<p>“I know, as the [Muley Fanatics] motto states, <em>Do the Right Thing</em>, that this calling is the right thing to do,” he wrote.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coursey’s announcement did not mention President Trump’s nominee for the <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-taps-former-wyoming-game-and-fish-chief-nesvik-to-lead-u-s-fish-and-wildlife-service/">top Fish and Wildlife Service post</a>, Brian Nesvik, who’s also a Wyoming resident. Nesvik, a <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/game-and-fish-chief-loves-y-stone-country/article_1730bcf6-f720-50f0-9fad-2c74f0a8e6dd.html">former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director</a>, is still undergoing his Senate confirmation. He’s <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyomings-nesvik-touts-america-first-deregulation-during-his-congressional-hearing-to-lead-fish-and-wildlife/">cleared the first</a> hearing and subsequent first vote, 10-9, along party lines, the <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/local/nesvik-narrowly-passes-first-vote-to-lead-fish-and-wildlife-service/article_cdcaae66-831a-4abd-8a2f-f9563b987fe1.html">Jackson Hole Daily reported</a>.</p>



<p>But Nesvik and Coursey run in the same Wyoming wildlife circles. The former Game and Fish director even appeared on Coursey’s podcast, Wild Things and Wild Places, in a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wild-things-wild-places/id1695931949?i=1000633991084">two-part</a> <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/wild-things-wild-places/id1695931949?i=1000634762445">series</a> in late 2023.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By some measures, Coursey is lesser known. Desirée Sorenson-Groves, who leads the nationwide National Wildlife Refuge Association, had never heard of him when reached by WyoFile on Thursday.</p>



<p>Sorenson-Groves’ hunch is that Coursey was selected as a “political” deputy director at the Fish and Wildlife Service. “That is what I would guess,” she said. “A guy named Siva had [the position] before.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Siva-Sundaresan-scaled.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Siva Sundaresan, pictured here in 2023 at Washakie Reservoir, was a former U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service deputy director during the Biden administration. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Siva Sundaresan, a former Wyoming resident, <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyo-ecologist-turned-activist-tapped-for-top-u-s-fish-and-wildlife-post/">was deputy director of the agency</a> under the Biden administration’s director, Martha Williams.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Besides Nesvik and Coursey, at least a couple other Wyoming residents have been selected for appointments by the Trump administration. Sheridan County resident Cyrus Western, a former Republican statehouse representative, was <a href="https://wyofile.com/a-qa-with-cyrus-western-who-will-oversee-trumps-epa-efforts-for-this-region/">picked to helm the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s</a> Region 8 office in Denver, Colorado. And Cheyenne attorney Karen Budd-Falen was <a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/burgum-taps-wyoming-cowboy-lawyer-as-acting-second-in-command/">selected as the acting deputy secretary</a> under U.S. Department of the Interior Secretary Doug Burgum.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Coursey told WyoFile he could not yet discuss the nature of his role or the issues he’ll be working on. </p>



<p>When he starts in May, he’ll be helping to lead a federal agency significantly diminished by the administration that selected him.&nbsp;The Trump administration’s Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency cuts have hit the Fish and Wildlife Service nationwide, including in Coursey’s home state of Wyoming. There are <a href="https://wyofile.com/musks-doge-to-eliminate-fish-and-wildlifes-tribal-lander-office-usgs-cheyenne-water-science-station/">plans to close the agency’s tribal office in Lander</a>, staffing impacts at places <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-cuts-may-cost-a-trout-brooding-wyoming-toad-rearing-federal-hatchery-its-entire-staff/">like the Saratoga National Fish Hatchery</a> and <a href="https://wyofile.com/a-source-of-wyoming-pride-black-footed-ferret-recovery-hamstrung-by-musks-doge/">blows to the Service’s black-footed ferret recovery efforts</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the behest of <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyomings-soon-to-drop-shed-hunting-rules-set-new-precedent/">state lawmakers</a>, Wyoming in 2024 took unprecedented steps to regulate shed antler hunting — actions that have started <a href="https://www.outdoorlife.com/hunting/idaho-nonresident-shed-hunting-license/">a western trend</a>. Specifically, the Equality State now requires out-of-state residents to get a conservation stamp and to wait a week, giving residents a head start. </p>



<p>Those changes caught <a href="https://wyofile.com/a-montana-shed-hunters-accidental-last-wyoming-dance/">some shed-seeking Westerners off-guard</a>. But the majority of antler seekers are relishing the new rules, wildlife officials now know.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“High levels of approval, in and of itself, shows that people were really receptive to the regulation,” said University of California-Berkeley PhD candidate Sam Maher, who’s been <a href="https://wyofile.com/the-typical-wyoming-shed-hunter-who-is-he-and-yes-he-is-a-man/">studying antler hunting in Wyoming since 2023</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Elk-shed-scaled.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A shed hunter sizes up his hand alongside the widest portion of a palmated elk antler in May 2022. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>In 2024, Maher and her collaborators surveyed 318 shed hunters online and in person at trailheads within the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, where there’s a seasonal closure on antler gathering until May 1. <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Appendices-Maher-et-al.-2025.pdf">The results suggest</a> that 64% of all respondents were in favor of the new restrictions on non-resident antler gathering. To no surprise, Wyoming residents who stood to benefit were the most on board: 87% favored the new rules, versus just 27% of non-residents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new regulations also motivated more locals to hit the hills. Some 22% of the Wyoming residents that Maher and company surveyed said they “would not have shed hunted otherwise,” but went out because there was the perception of less competition. Non-residents, meanwhile, were effectively dissuaded from coming to Wyoming, even after they could on May 8. Some 29% of those surveyed reported not coming because of the new regulations.&nbsp;</p>





<p>“We asked residents and non-residents how it changed their behavior,” Maher said of the new rules. “It seemed like the increased enthusiasm by residents offset the fact that non-residents couldn&#8217;t come in for the first week.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studying under UC-Berkeley professor and seasonal Wyoming resident Arthur Middleton, Maher has been examining the <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/03/14/the-great-american-antler-boom">burgeoning pursuit of antlers</a> in the American West for a chapter in her dissertation. The first batch of data she received after her 2023 surveys provided new insights into the demographic makeup of shed hunters: The majority are<a href="https://wyofile.com/the-typical-wyoming-shed-hunter-who-is-he-and-yes-he-is-a-man/"> white male westerners</a> who like nature and exercise and are not motivated by the <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/valley/feature/elk-fest-cleans-up/article_107283fa-1616-11ef-8f01-a7df65ee1403.html">high dollar that elkhorn can fetch</a>. She’s adapted the results into a user-friendly <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/33efbbbb78ba4a3ca2e0ec871719745f">story map dubbed “Brown Gold Rush.”</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_8504_1-e1705075305983.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A shed hunter with a big haul crosses Flat Creek on the Bridger-Teton National Forest adjacent to the National Elk Refuge. (Sam Maher)</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s also a greater goal for the research. Maher and the University of Wyoming’s Tyler Kjorstad are working on an academic paper, <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/maher-et-al-2025.pdf">“The emerging need to manage scavenged wildlife resources,</a>” that’s going through the peer-review process with the Journal of Biological Conservation.</p>



<p>Kjorstad, who’s with UW’s College of Business, is also working with Maher on another paper estimating the economic contribution of shed hunting in Wyoming. All the data they’re amassing, he said, is useful outside of academia.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There&#8217;s information that&#8217;s advantageous for policy managers and ecologists, and in my opinion, economists,” Kjorstad told WyoFile.</p>





<p>The steps that Wyoming has taken to regulate shed antler hunting are “a big deal,” Maher said. Those regulations started with seasonal closures back in 2009 to protect wintering wildlife, but have since evolved to protect the experience of shed antler hunting. Antlers fall into a “weird gray area” because, after they separate from an animal, they’re typically not protected from commercial sale, like wild game meat is.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The act of regulating this is pretty unprecedented and interesting,” Maher said. It sets the stage, she said, for land and wildlife managers to regulate “similar resources,” naming bird feathers, snake skins and seashells.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already, neighboring states are copying Wyoming’s approach to regulating shed hunting. Starting in 2025, for example, <a href="https://www.outdoorlife.com/hunting/idaho-nonresident-shed-hunting-license/">out-of-state shed hunters in Idaho</a> will have to possess a nonresident hunting license — <a href="https://idfg.idaho.gov/licenses/fees-nonresident">a $185 investment</a>. The Montana Legislature also is weighing a bill that proposes a $50 non-resident license fee for shed hunting, <a href="https://projects.montanafreepress.org/capitol-tracker-2025/bills/hb-897/">according to the Montana Free Press</a>’ bill tracker.</p>

<p>A dismayed Chris Servheen is raising the alarm about what’s become of federal scientists who have kept watch over the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly bear population for the last 55 years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The group of research biologists and technicians, known as the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, are being hamstrung at best and arguably dismantled, he told WyoFile. For decades, until his retirement in 2016, Sevheen worked closely with the study team while coordinating grizzly bear recovery for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s functionally destroying the organization,” Servheen said Thursday. “The study team has been in place since 1970 — over 50 years of work and experience and knowledge. It&#8217;s going to just disappear and die.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Servheen’s perplexed about what the Trump administration has to gain.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“How could anybody be so negligent and vile that they&#8217;re trying to destroy something that has brought grizzly bears back from the edge of extinction?” he said. “Why would you do that? It&#8217;s just so destructive.”</p>



<p>Led by Elon Musk, the Department of Government Efficiency’s dismantling started with a hiring freeze. Longtime <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/mark-haroldson">supervisory wildlife biologist Mark Haroldson</a> retired, and his position is not being filled, according to Servheen. Then, the team’s longtime leader, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/frank-t-van-manen">Frank van Manen</a>, announced an earlier-than-desired retirement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“He didn’t want to leave,” Servheen said of van Manen, who declined to comment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Frank-van-Manen-scaled.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Frank van Manen, leader of the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team, at the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee&#8217;s Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee meeting in Cody in May 2023. (Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Servheen, van Manen’s departure was related to the federal government&#8217;s ongoing upheaval.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They’re putting fear into people,” Servheen said. “That’s basically evil, to do that to hard-working people who have been civil servants for decades.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team is part of the U.S. Geological Survey, and its website lists four other employees. Three are technicians, which are often seasonal, entry-level employees. The remaining staff biologist has been in the job about three years.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“They’re putting fear into people. That’s basically evil, to do that to hard-working people who have been civil servants for decades.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Chris servheen</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>If any of the study team’s employees opt to stick it out amid a <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2025/04/what-federal-workers-should-consider-before-accepting-deferred-resignation/">second wave of buyouts</a>, they’re likely to be out of an office space come fall. The Northern Rocky Mountain Science Center, <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/centers/norock/message-director-claudia-regan">described by its director</a> as “one of the nation’s key laboratories to study the ecosystems and species of the Northern Rockies,” is one of hundreds of federal facilities being shuttered by DOGE.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Although located in Bozeman, many of the federal facility’s researchers do work in Wyoming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They do all kinds of other stuff: brucellosis and chronic wasting disease and aquatic species,” Servheen said. “It&#8217;s a huge science center.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The planned closure has elicited protests. <a href="https://yellowstonian.org/42-biologists-with-1350-years-of-experience-say-doge-closure-of-fed-science-center-is-wrong/">According</a><a href="http://yellowstonian.org"> to Yellowstonian.org</a>, 42 retired or active biologists petitioned Montana’s congressional delegation to use their influence to “protect [the science center] and its employees from these unwarranted attacks by DOGE.”</p>





<p>Federal offices located in Wyoming have not escaped the closures. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s tribal-focused Lander conservation office and a USGS Cheyenne water science station are <a href="https://wyofile.com/musks-doge-to-eliminate-fish-and-wildlifes-tribal-lander-office-usgs-cheyenne-water-science-station/">among those that have been marked</a> for the chopping block.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WyoFile could not officially confirm impacts to the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team. Federal agencies under the Trump administration have declined or not responded to WyoFile’s requests for more information on downsizing and office closures. An inquiry to a USGS public affairs officer on Thursday yielded no information about the matter.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Center for Biological Diversity has been pressing the federal agency for details as well. On Thursday, the environmental advocacy organization publicized a <a href="https://biologicaldiversity.org/programs/carnivore-conservation/pdfs/2025.04.10-FOIA-Request-to-USGS-RE-IGBST-&amp;-DOGE.pdf">Freedom of Information Act request</a> to gain more insight into the future of the federal grizzly team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both recently departed veteran study team members — van Manen and Haroldson — are staying engaged in grizzly science in pro-bono emeritus roles, according to a source familiar with the situation.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Griz-distribution-map.png?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Federally protected grizzly bears have steadily increased their range, in green, over the past four decades. (Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Nevertheless, Servheen worries that the hit to the science team could trickle down to the grizzly population — estimated at <a href="https://wyofile.com/the-new-way-biologists-count-yellowstone-region-grizzly-bears-explained/">1,000 or so </a>bears in the Greater Yellowstone — that it’s charged with studying.</p>



<p>Over the decades, federal researchers have played a pivotal role in improving understanding of the region’s bruins, <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/pine-decline-ok-for-grizzly/article_2848a4c4-14ef-524f-94e5-a2d824aa8728.html">including completing studies</a> that have helped make the case that grizzly bears are fully recovered and no longer require Endangered Species Act protection. They’ve also amassed <a href="https://wyofile.com/yellowstone-region-grizzlies-are-dying-at-a-near-record-pace-managers-arent-alarmed/">mortality</a> and other demographic datasets and <a href="https://igbconline.org/grizzly-bear-study-team/">compiled an annual report</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The foundation of Yellowstone grizzly bear recovery has been built on science,” Servheen said. “Removing that science eliminates our ability to maintain Yellowstone grizzly bears.”</p>
