Economist sees ‘disaster.’"></a></p>
<p>Gov. Mark Gordon said he sees &#8220;opportunity&#8221; for Wyoming in President Donald Trump&#8217;s tariff wars. At a press conference last week, he echoed the Wyoming congressional delegation&#8217;s praise for Trump&#8217;s economic policies as a tool to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and level the nation&#8217;s trade imbalance with much of the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Trump tariffs have kind of shuffled the deck, in a way, and I think it&#8217;s a great opportunity for Wyoming to be able to pick up the game,&#8221; Gordon told reporters while highlighting his April <a href="https://wyofile.com/governor-trade-mission-to-japan-taiwan-could-increase-wyoming-fossil-fuel-exports/">trade mission to Japan and Taiwan</a>. &#8220;Taiwan very much understood that they can buy more [U.S.] energy and that will help their situation in the trade deficit.&#8221;</p>



<p>But southwest Wyoming, the world&#8217;s largest exporter of natural soda ash, along with agricultural producers, businesses reliant on tourism and natural resource extractive industries across the state — as well as ordinary Equality State consumers of almost anything — have cause for concern, according to one Wyoming economist.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just no good way to spin the Trump administration&#8217;s economic policies in the short term,&#8221; University of Wyoming Associate Professor of Economics Rob Godby told WyoFile. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been disastrous, and they&#8217;re going to be disastrous.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

(Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The global oil market dominates much of the world&#8217;s economy and plays an outsized role in the nation&#8217;s economic pulse, especially Wyoming&#8217;s, Godby noted. So far, the market&#8217;s reaction is pointing to economic decline. That&#8217;s bad for Wyoming&#8217;s economy across the board, he said, and portends lower revenues to the state&#8217;s coffers.</p>



<p>Godby also serves on the state&#8217;s Consensus Revenue Estimating Group, which consists of the state&#8217;s top bean-counters tasked with estimating revenues to fund state and local governments. While tourism and agriculture play vital roles in the state&#8217;s revenue picture, Godby and his fellow CREG members closely monitor coal, oil and natural gas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to providing more than $2.4 billion in state revenues in 2023, the oil and natural gas industry supported nearly 59,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/energy-environment/exxon-chevron-earnings.html">U.S. oil prices have declined since Jan. 20</a>, when Trump began his second term in the White House, slipping by about 20% to around $56 per barrel over the weekend.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would say that the biggest effect on our revenues is really the indirect effect that will be caused by world oil prices, which is really driving down [Wyoming] oil revenues, especially in the last month and a half,&#8221; Godby said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not quite seeing it yet in terms of reported numbers, but we know it&#8217;s going to hit us because these prices are well below what we expected.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CREG group is on the front lines of measuring Wyoming&#8217;s vulnerability in international trade and the overall U.S. economy, according to Gordon&#8217;s office. Gordon&#8217;s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile, &#8220;We&#8217;re monitoring the tariff situation closely, which is constantly changing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meantime, there are more acute concerns for Wyoming regarding Trump&#8217;s tariffs and potential retaliatory responses among U.S. trade partners, Godby said.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trona and soda ash</strong></h4>



<p>Trona mined in Wyoming is processed into “natural” soda ash — a key component in the production of glass, baking soda and myriad other products. Wyoming’s trona and soda ash industry employs more than 2,000 workers, compared to about 4,100 direct jobs in Wyoming coal mining, according to the Wyoming Mining Association.</p>



<p>By far, soda ash is the state&#8217;s biggest foreign export commodity in terms of sales. Of Wyoming&#8217;s $2 billion in total exports in 2024, soda ash accounted for about $1.3 billion, according to Godby. China, Trump&#8217;s primary target in his tariff wars, typically accounts for about 10% of those soda ash purchases.</p>

<p>If the industry were to lose that 10%, it would be a significant blow, Godby said. What&#8217;s worse is the possibility that tariff wars might give a price advantage to synthetic soda ash, which Wyoming does not produce, and put a drag on exports to other nations.</p>



<p>&#8220;That could be a really significant impact on our [soda ash] exports,&#8221; he said, adding that it might even dampen plans for major expansions of trona mining and soda ash refining operations in the region.</p>



<p>WE Soda’s <a href="https://projectwest.com/">Project West</a>, a multi-billion dollar trona solution-mine expansion project now under construction near Granger, will create 2,000 temporary construction jobs, more than 400 permanent jobs and boost annual production by 3 million metric tons, according to the company. Pacific Soda&#8217;s proposed Dry Creek Trona Mine Project south of Green River, which has also crossed several <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2016395/510">regulatory approval milestones</a>, would bring in another 2,000 construction jobs and create about 300 full-time jobs, according to the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This vital development [the Dry Creek Trona Mine] will create hundreds of good-paying jobs for hardworking Wyoming families while strengthening our domestic supply chain for essential minerals that keep costs lower at the store for everyday Americans,&#8221; Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a prepared statement last week.</p>

<p>While the state&#8217;s trona and soda ash producers have been very &#8220;bullish&#8221; regarding exports in recent years, global dynamics for the commodities could change drastically if Trump&#8217;s trade wars escalate, according to Godby. Though the industry is not among the top three major influencers regarding the state&#8217;s overall revenue picture, &#8220;it does affect southwest Wyoming,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Though the industry may struggle in terms of past expectations to increase exports, Gordon said he hopes Trump&#8217;s policies might actually result in bringing glass manufacturing, which relies on soda ash, back to the U.S. and for the first time in Wyoming.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a long shot, but we&#8217;re really talking about bringing in glass manufacturers,&#8221; Gordon said, noting that he and his team visited with <a href="https://www.corning.com/careers/tw/en/careers/Locations/Taiwan.html">glass manufacturer Corning</a> while in Taiwan. &#8220;We talked about the possibility of being able to locate manufacturing here — a longtime dream of people in Wyoming. It may be a little bit more of an opportunity now with the backdrop of those tariffs.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oh, Canada, and China</strong></h4>



<p>Wyoming&#8217;s other vulnerability in international tariff wars is its reliance on Canada, the state&#8217;s largest international trading partner. The nation to the north accounts for about 20% of the state&#8217;s exports and 55% of imports, according to Godby. That translates into significant exposure for multiple goods, including robust trade of agricultural, manufacturing and heavy machinery components that both nations rely on in their natural resource extractive industries.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> &#8220;If you really wanted to sandbag the U.S. economy, you couldn&#8217;t have done much of a better job.&#8221;</p><cite>Rob Godby, University of Wyoming</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>&#8220;That clearly is going to have supply chain effects in terms of impacts on consumers, or impacts on what we produce, given the products that we bring in from Canada,&#8221; Godby said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If [Trump] gets tough with Canada, they&#8217;ll get tough back,&#8221; he added, noting the recent election of Prime Minister Mark Carney, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/americas/canada-election-results-carney-poilievre-intl-hnk">promises to rebuke Trump&#8217;s policies</a>. &#8220;Even though they know it hurts, they&#8217;re willing to do that, and Wyoming would be a victim of that trade war.&#8221;</p>



<p>Combined, Canada and China account for nearly 65% of Wyoming&#8217;s imports, according to Godby. &#8220;Clearly, Wyoming could be impacted much more than the nation as a whole, if we get into a kind of a trade dispute with those two countries.&#8221;</p>



<p>Still, based on his recent <a href="https://wyofile.com/governor-trade-mission-to-japan-taiwan-could-increase-wyoming-fossil-fuel-exports/">trade mission to Japan and Taiwan</a>, Gordon said he believes the tariff and trade policy negotiations serve as motivation for those markets — as well as others — to balance their trade deficits with the United States. Though he heard concerns about Trump&#8217;s tariffs and retaliatory trade policies, he also heard assurances that Japan and Taiwan are interested in balancing their trade with the U.S. Ways to do that could include importing more Wyoming-produced coal, natural gas, uranium and soda ash, as well as <a href="https://wyofile.com/why-wyoming-bar-nunn-crowd-seeks-info-on-plan-to-build-portable-nuclear-microreactors/">nuclear microreactors</a> that might be manufactured here.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Prime Minister [of Japan, <a href="https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/actions/202504/24hyoukei.html">Shigeru Ishiba]</a> said, &#8216;Look, we were [at an 80% trade imbalance with the U.S.] in the 1980s and now we&#8217;re less than 20%. So, you know, we&#8217;re anxious to work with you to rebalance,'&#8221; Gordon said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That type of interest includes potential investments by both Japan and Taiwan to expand port capacities in the U.S. and on their shores to increase the flow of Wyoming coal and natural gas to those and other Asian nations, he added.</p>



<p>Though Wyoming might see some new deals to ship energy commodities to Asian markets, Godby said, it would be despite escalating tariffs. The state may even land new manufacturing here at home, but those are long-term outcomes that first have to be built on investor confidence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hope is not a strategy,&#8221; Godby said. Even if the Trump administration pumps the brakes on tariffs completely, he added, there&#8217;s already a certain level of damage done to U.S. trade relations — and a big part of that is the fact that nobody knows what the Trump administration will do next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;With just general uncertainty, you&#8217;re going to see [investments] go down, which is going to hurt our economy. There&#8217;s no way to win that,&#8221; Godby said. &#8220;If you really wanted to sandbag the U.S. economy, you couldn&#8217;t have done much of a better job.&#8221;</p>

<p>The majority of visitors to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks value wildlife viewing so much that they would support a park-related fee or tax toward habitat conservation, a new study finds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.70051">“Tradeoffs and win-wins between large landscape conservation and wildlife viewing in protected areas,”</a> was published Sunday in <em>Conservation Science and Practice. </em>Along with establishing support for paying conservation fees, the paper concludes that species population declines could have a greater effect on park visitation than imposing such fees.</p>



<p>“Visitors responded that they would be likely to visit the parks less if there were fewer wildlife to see,” said co-author Hilary Byerly Flint, a researcher with the University of Wyoming’s Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study looked specifically at Wyoming’s two northwestern national parks, and co-authors include Byerly Flint and Drew Bennett with the Haub School; migration researcher Arthur Middleton with the University of California, Berkeley; Leslie Richardson with the National Park Service’s economics program and Aaron Enriquez with the U.S. Geological Survey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authors say the study cements with data what many people already know: Seeing grizzly bears, elk, wolves or other animals in the wild is tremendously valuable to the public. So valuable that most would pony up to support conservation efforts beyond park boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For the vast majority of people who visit the parks, it&#8217;s mind blowing” to see something like an elk bugling, said Scott Christensen, executive director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, which helped fund the study. “It&#8217;s almost a once-in-a-lifetime experience for them, and it has real, tangible value.”</p>

<p>The concept of a conservation fee in national parks is not new, though it has yet to gain required federal traction to be enacted. Authors hope the study can be used to continue the dialogue, Byerly Flint said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we see this really as the start of a conversation about how to pay for conservation in these areas that are increasingly threatened,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re seeing the loss of habitat for these migratory ungulates at unprecedented rates,” Byerly Flint continued. And that leads to the question of: “How to pay for conservation of that habitat, while also maintaining the benefits and the wonderful experiences that park visitors enjoy when they come to Yellowstone and Grand Teton?”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Genesis</strong></h4>



<p>In 2018, former Wyoming State Rep. Al Sommers, a Sublette County rancher, sponsored a <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2018/HJ0005">joint resolution</a> relating to the collection of wildlife conservation fees at Yellowstone and Grand Teton. His resolution requested that the Department of the Interior and National Park Service enter into an agreement with Wyoming to collect a wildlife conservation fee at the parks to generate revenue for conservation efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Legislature passed the resolution, and Gov. Mark Gordon signed it, but those fees have not gained federal approval.</p>



<p>“My priority was conflict resolution,” Sommers told WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whether it’s grizzly bears or wolves, or elk or, frankly, wildlife on highways,” Sommers said, the fee was envisioned as “a way to generate money from all of the public, from the national public that enjoys these wildlife in the park, to help mitigate some of the cost associated with that and to ensure wildlife’s viability.”</p>



<p>Two years later, Middleton co-authored a paper titled <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.335">“Harnessing visitors&#8217; enthusiasm for national parks to fund cooperative large-landscape conservation,”</a> which further explored the concept. That study examined legal and political challenges and estimated that a fee of up to $10 per vehicle could generate up to $13 million annually for conservation projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new study takes the issue a step further, Byerly Flint said, by examining “what park visitors themselves think about the idea of contributing towards conservation and how important the animals that require habitat beyond park boundaries are to park visitor experiences.”</p>



<p>In summer 2022, a research assistant spent two months surveying visitors of Yellowstone and Grand Teton parks — both inside their boundaries and outside in communities like Jackson and Cody. </p>



<p>Researchers analyzed 991 responses. Just over 75% of respondents cited wildlife viewing as a primary reason for their trips to Yellowstone and Grand Teton. The majority also supported the idea of paying extra for conservation —&nbsp;with 93% supportive of a voluntary donation; 75% supportive of a tax or fee on goods and services; and 66% supportive of a mandatory wildlife conservation fee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study also found that wildlife viewing generates an estimated $581 million in annual recreational value in the two national parks, representing a significant economic engine. Yellowstone tallied 4.74 million visitations in 2024 — the second highest year on record. Grand Teton, meanwhile, reported 3.62 million, its third highest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly half of respondents, furthermore, said they would take fewer trips to the parks if there were fewer wide-ranging wildlife to view. That, researchers calculated, could result in about a 15% decrease in overall park visitation.</p>

(Screengrab)
</figcaption></figure>



<p>The results illustrate support for a basic trade off, the study concludes. Visitors are willing to pony up rather than risk long-term wildlife declines. </p>



<p>“These wide-ranging wildlife, like elk and mule deer and grizzly bears, are hugely important to park visitor experiences, to the reasons they decide to visit the parks,” Byerly Flint said.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Sommers’ resolution, along with a similar version passed in Montana, was nonbinding. Any change in park fees falls under the purview of the National Park Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyoming’s park superintendents have indicated support for wildlife, Byerly Flint noted. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly declined to comment for this story; Grand Teton Superintendent Chip Jenkins didn’t respond by publication time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Byerly Flint said, the paper underscores the point that “the value of the experience within the park boundaries is contingent upon what&#8217;s happening outside of park boundaries.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Support for a fee or donation was regardless of income or politics, the report found. In terms of diminishing returns, researchers found that a cost increase of more than $75 would equate to the same reduction in visits that might result from fewer wildlife to view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study does not mean the co-authors are set on fees as a solution, Byerly Flint said. “This is one way. This isn&#8217;t necessarily <em>the way. </em>It&#8217;s just an idea that we&#8217;re exploring.”</p>



<p>Christensen of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition echoed that sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every animal that spends time in the parks also spends time outside of the parks and in these unprotected areas,” he said. “And so our interest in this study is really around trying to come up with some innovative approaches for how to pay for conservation long term. I think what this study tells us, and gives us some hope around, is that people are willing to do that … there’s a willingness there.”</p>

But congressional budgeting could kill it."></a></p>
<p>As the Wyoming Legislature met in early February, a lawmaker from the state’s southwest corner announced to his fellow representatives that the Trump administration had thrown out the Bureau of Land Management’s controversial Rock Springs resource management plan, <a href="https://wyofile.com/biden-administration-finalizes-rock-springs-plan-without-further-changes/">completed just weeks before</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But word of its death, <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/02/06/trump-administration-shuts-down-controversial-biden-era-rock-springs-management-plan/">parroted by</a> some in the media, was premature. U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s <a href="https://www.doi.gov/document-library/secretary-order/so-3418-unleashing-american-energy">“Unleashing American Energy” order</a>, which triggered the erroneous reports, said that the <a href="https://wyofile.com/blms-final-rock-springs-plan-seeks-balance-of-resource-development-and-wildlife-protections/">final plan for 3.6 million acres</a> of the Red Desert and checkerboard region would be &#8220;reviewed and, as appropriate, revised.&#8221; Months later, the federal resource management plan remains in effect.</p>



<p>“It’s still active. It’s not frozen,” BLM-Wyoming spokesman Micky Fisher told WyoFile. “We are now just identifying possible options.”</p>



<p>What path BLM takes to satisfy Burgum’s order is being decided at the agency’s Washington headquarters, Fisher said. Amending the plan through the established National Environmental Policy Act review process is among the options, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-do-the-secretary-of-the-interiors-recent-orders-mean/id1395671263?i=1000698239250">policy experts have predicted.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Congress, however, could take away BLM’s ability to decide for itself. Wyoming’s lone U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman has <a href="https://wyofile.com/in-new-leadership-post-hageman-takes-fresh-aim-at-federal-land-grizzly-policies/">brought such bills</a>. Her staff did not respond to a request Monday seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Hageman-8.6.24-c.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, pictured in 2024 at a town hall in Jackson, has spearheaded efforts to rescind the Bureau of Land Management&#8217;s Rock Springs Resource Management Plan via congressional action. (Angus M. Thuermer, Jr./WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>There has also been <a href="https://wyofile.com/gop-led-congress-could-toss-rock-springs-plan-in-2025-using-an-unprecedented-move/">talk of using the Congressional Review Act</a> to overturn the land-use plan, which was <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/02/01/2011-2201/notice-of-intent-to-prepare-a-resource-management-plan-for-the-rock-springs-field-office-wyoming-and">nearly 14 years in the making</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet another possible route for Congress to undo the plan, which <a href="https://wyofile.com/misinformation-hysteria-dominate-response-to-blms-plan-for-sw-wyoming/">caused a political furor</a> during its draft stages, is to address it during the ongoing budget reconciliation process. That remains on the table.</p>



<p>Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, included two provisions in his <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II00/20250506/118151/BILLS-119-CommitteePrint-W000821-Amdt-012.pdf">draft reconciliation bill</a> that address BLM resource management plans in Wyoming. One would not allow the BLM to “implement, administer or enforce” the RMP for its Rock Springs field office. The other includes the same prohibitionary language for BLM acting on its new plan for its Buffalo Field Office — which includes a coal-leasing ban in the Powder River Basin that’s now <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-montana-sue-feds-to-repeal-powder-river-basin-coal-leasing-ban/">being litigated</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/notice_--_full_committee_markup_of_committee_print_05.06.25.pdf">markup of the draft reconciliation bill is scheduled for 8:15 a.m.</a> MST on Tuesday. Ultimately, the provisions could lead to the Rock Springs and Buffalo plans being killed by only a simple majority vote — budget reconciliation isn’t subject to the filibuster, so only 51 votes are needed to get it through the U.S. Senate.</p>



<p>That’s a possibility that has conservation groups in Wyoming on guard. Congress — via budget reconciliation or otherwise — has never successfully thrown out a federal land-use plan, said Julia Stuble, Wyoming director for The Wilderness Society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We can&#8217;t find an example of this kind of congressional overreach … being successful,&#8221; Stuble said. “We’ve certainly seen some attempts at this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not a sure thing that the resource management plan provisions will carry forward. Provisions in budget reconciliation must have a direct effect on the federal budget, and it’s unclear if congressional rules would allow for RMP provisions.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lt.-MT-Elk-herd-sbb_14111.jpeg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A large elk herd kicks up a cloud of dust as it evacuates a hillside on Little Mountain, a peak east of Flaming Gorge Reservoir within the Bureau of Land Management’s Rock Springs Field Office. (Steven Brutger)</figcaption></figure>



<p>If congressional Republicans do carry the provisions forward successfully, it’d set a bad precedent in Stuble’s view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think anyone who believes that the small government closest to the people is the best form of government should be opposed to this kind of overreach from Congress,” she said. “Because land-use plans, like RMPs, are developed at a local level, with tons of input from elected officials, community members and stakeholders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not everyone in Wyoming is on that page. Rep. Cody Wylie, a Republican representative from Rock Springs who prematurely announced the RMP’s death during the legislative session, believes that local interests were cut out of the BLM’s process. That decision charted the future of millions of acres of public land surrounding his legislative district.</p>



<p>“The way it was written, it was completely biased — not even conservation, but preservation,” Wylie said. “That’s just not realistic for the state of Wyoming. Our economy has run off of the extraction industries.” </p>



<p>Efforts to strike more of a balance between <a href="https://wyofile.com/blms-final-rock-springs-plan-seeks-balance-of-resource-development-and-wildlife-protections/">conservation and industrial development in the final plan</a> didn’t alleviate his concerns.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Wylie prefers that Congress not throw the plan out entirely, so the BLM doesn’t have to start from scratch. An amendment to the 2024 plan, he said, would be ideal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Then they can [include] all that informational work that&#8217;s been done over the last 15 years,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if congressional Republicans successfully throw out the new plan and BLM has to revert to its 1997 RMP, he won&#8217;t protest.</p>



<p>“I think we can live with that until we redo the RMP process,” Wylie said.</p>

<p>LARAMIE—A March <a href="https://wyofile.com/appeals-court-backs-corner-crossers-in-wyoming-public-lands-case/">ruling</a> by a federal appeals court in a widely watched corner-crossing case determined that private landowners cannot bar access to public lands with fences, trespass actions or other methods.</p>



<p>Hunters, recreators and public lands advocates celebrated the ruling and its implications for the states within the 10th Circuit — Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Oklahoma and Kansas.</p>



<p>Thursday, however, Ryan Semerad, the attorney who represented the <a href="https://wyofile.com/corner-crossing/">four Missouri hunters in the </a>federal civil lawsuit, urged recreators to exercise caution and goodwill if attempting to corner cross — or step from one piece of public land to another where those two parcels meet at a common corner with two private parcels, in a checkboard pattern of ownership. Wyoming’s checkerboard spans more than 2 million acres.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are limitations to that decision,” Semerad said Thursday during a corner-crossing panel discussion in Laramie. “That doesn&#8217;t mean go jump on your side by side … and just have at it. It doesn&#8217;t mean you get to go on private property without permission, consent or something else. What it means is that you have reasonable access to step from one section to the next section, so long as you can be situated appropriately, you know where the monument marker is, you know where you&#8217;re going and you respect that.”</p>

(Wyoming Backcountry Hunters and Anglers)</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are also outstanding questions for landowners, said Wyoming Stock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna, another panelist. His group filed an amicus brief in the case in support of the landowner who sued the Missouri hunters for stepping over, but never touching, Elk Mountain Ranch property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s pretty clear that you cannot deny access to these checkerboard lands,” Magagna said. “Does that mean that you have to allow crossing at every corner? If I want to identify one of the four corners that I control as the access point, do I have the liberty to do that? Or if I want to designate a path through the middle of my private land in lieu of granting access across the corners?</p>



<p>“Those are many of the questions that still remain out there to be addressed,” Magagna said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As they talked, it became clear that interpretations of the ruling still vary widely. But both urged common sense and respectful communication —&nbsp;traditional tenets of Wyoming hunting etiquette regarding private landowners.</p>



<p>“We need to remember that it&#8217;s a culture of cooperation with these lands, and that&#8217;s how this is going to work moving forward,” Semerad said.</p>



<p>The panel was part of the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation Summit, a two-day event bringing together outdoor recreation business leaders, public lands agency officials, nonprofits and others to strengthen the burgeoning industry and enhance access to resources. The summit is one product of newly expanded state government support of the outdoor recreation —&nbsp;Wyoming’s Office of Outdoor Recreation helps put it on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Appropriately, the panel addressed a legal question that has captivated recreators in Wyoming and the nation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hunters, a wealthy landowner, trespass charges</strong> </h4>



<p>In 2020, hunters Brad Cape, John Slowensky and Phillip Yeomans corner crossed to hunt on Elk Mountain, then did so again with Zach Smith in 2021.</p>



<p>Carbon County ranch owner Fred Eshelman sued the four men in 2022 for passing through the airspace above his property on their way to hunt.</p>



<p>Eshelman sued to block them, and anyone else, from corner crossing to reach some 11,000 acres of federal and state land enmeshed in his 50-square-mile ranch, a coveted hunting ground known for its abundant wildlife.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="602" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?resize=780%2C602&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-112206" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?resize=1024%2C790&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?resize=400%2C309&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic-1024x790.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The appeals court used this graphic to depict corner crossing. (IU.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)</figcaption></figure>



<p>That set off a series of court challenges and appeals in a case that involved everything from the limits of private property rights to the extent of airspace and the legality of preventing the public from accessing public land.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With implications not only for the 2.4 million acres of “corner-locked” land in Wyoming, but also for 8.3 million acres across the West, the case gained national attention, particularly among hunters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It culminated in March with the appeals court decision. In a unanimous opinion, the three-judge panel sided against Eshelman, citing an act of Congress that preempts Wyoming trespass law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congress enacted the Unlawful Inclosures Act in 1885. “No one may completely prevent or obstruct another from peacefully entering or freely passing over or through public lands,” the act says, according to the appellate judges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The act, which explicitly prohibits “obstructing transit over public lands by force, threats, intimidation, or by any fencing or inclosing,” supersedes Wyoming trespass law, the judges ruled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that means in practical terms, Semerad said Thursday, is this: “You can now step from one section of public land to the next. In Wyoming, there is no state law, statute or regulation that can stop you; the federal law would preempt it.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Questions remain </strong></h4>



<p>Magagna believes the ruling is aimed explicitly at the checkerboard — not islands of public land surrounded by private land elsewhere, he said Thursday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Semerad disagreed. “The Unlawful Inclosures Act applies to all public lands,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderator Dan McCoy, director of the Jay Kemmerer WORTH Institute, asked if the Wyoming Legislature or the state could have a bearing on the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee will discuss corner crossing when it holds an interim meeting June 5-6 in Dubois.&nbsp;</p>

(Steven Brutger)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though the ruling clearly states the Unlawful Inclosures Act is supreme, Magagna said, “I think where there is opportunity, potentially for the Legislature should they choose to do so, is to better define the tools that are available and the limitations on the use of those tools.” He also brought up land exchanges by which more public land could become accessible without the necessity of corner crossing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what should recreators do if they come across a corner that’s fenced off, McCoy asked.</p>



<p>“If you come across a fenced corner, call me, call the U.S. Attorney’s office because that&#8217;s unlawful,” Semerad said. “That is straight up a violation of the Unlawful Inclosures Act.”</p>



<p>The March decision might not be the final word in the corner-crossing case. There is a chance it will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, Semerad said. The earliest the high court could see it is next winter, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, both men stressed a spirit of collaboration when it comes to public land users and private property owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Respect and cooperation is always going to take us much further than if we&#8217;re just going to be battling it out all the time,” Semerad said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real answer to all this, to me and I think to many people I represent,” Magagna added, “is the relationships we build in Wyoming with people, between private landowners and the recreation and outdoor community, particularly the sportsmen, hunters and fishermen. So I think that the key thing, for now at least, is to build those relationships.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Wyoming Refinery in Newcastle has resumed operations months after an apparent explosion in February forced the facility to remain idle for repairs.</p>



<p>The refinery shut down following the Feb. 12 incident, which refinery owner Par Pacific of Houston called an &#8220;operational upset.&#8221; The company would not provide details of what happened beyond &#8220;the main crude heater needed to be replaced&#8221; and that there was an &#8220;unexpected and unavoidable equipment malfunction,&#8221; according to WyoFile interviews and company communications with state officials.</p>



<p>Weston County Emergency Management posted on Facebook the night of the incident that &#8220;a heater blew up&#8221; at the refinery.</p>



<p>No injuries were reported.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some fuel production resumed on April 21, it will be some time before the refinery is back to full capacity of 20,000 barrels a day, Dallas Scholes, Par Pacific&#8217;s government and public affairs director, told WyoFile.</p>

<p>&#8220;When you bring one of these facilities back online, you&#8217;ve got to take it slow,&#8221; Scholes said. Because the equipment has been idle for months, making sure everything is running correctly and safely takes time, from bringing the heat up to making sure the oil can move through. &#8220;There&#8217;s a lot that is involved, and our No. 1 priority in this whole process is to make sure it&#8217;s safe, and that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re focused on.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company is not projecting when the refinery will resume full operational capacity, but it is providing updates on a <a href="https://newcastleheaterresponse.com/?fbclid=IwY2xjawJ_U9FleHRuA2FlbQIxMQBicmlkETE0ZmpBUTBSVTV3cnNwMEZkAR7yxR0gJ0jAfQ9Qbgue5v8-cj5PwSELf4K74Uuupp_oo97D9-Am_HAhMF_xfA_aem_gAmVzz98t61FnE1o_e67Mg">website</a> dedicated to the incident.</p>



<p>Even with fuel production shut down, the refinery&#8217;s workforce has been hard at work, according to Scholes.</p>



<p>&#8220;They are some really incredibly hard-working people, and they were doing a lot of extra shifts,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We used everybody we could on site, and we brought in a lot of really good experts to fill in the gaps and to make things work. They were gainfully employed the whole time. I&#8217;m really proud of what they were able to step up and do.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The facility produces gasoline, diesel, jet fuel and propane from Powder River Basin crude, according to the company. The economic impact on the region motivated Par Pacific to get the refinery back in operation as soon as possible, Scholes said.&nbsp;</p>

(Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality)</figcaption></figure>



<p>&#8220;We stored a lot [of unrefined crude], but that is one of the reasons why we wanted to work as fast as we could — so that we can make sure that oil is still flowing and still available, and to make sure that our producers are still gainfully employed at the end of the day as well.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The ‘explosion’</strong></h4>



<p>The company doesn&#8217;t use the term &#8220;explosion&#8221; in public-facing communications, and instead refers to the incident as an &#8220;operational upset.&#8221; However, in a <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Wyo-Refining-Co-letter-to-DEQ-March.pdf">March 24 letter</a> to the Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality, Health, Safety, Security &amp; Environment Manager Michael Baldwin wrote, &#8220;During the evening of Feb. 12, [the refinery] experienced an explosion in their crude heater … which resulted in a total shutdown of the refinery.&#8221;</p>



<p>The incident did not result in any liquid spills or significant airborne gaseous or powder emissions, according to the company. &#8220;There were no emissions that left our fence line,&#8221; Scholes said.</p>



<p>Regulatory officials are still in the process of investigating the incident in coordination with Par Pacific.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>&#8220;Things can go wrong, and we live every day doing everything we can to make sure that they don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p><cite>Dallas Scholes, Par Pacific</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The cause of the incident remains unclear. The company has refused to elaborate. &#8220;That [information] has not been passed on to me,&#8221; Scholes told WyoFile.</p>



<p>In a written communication to DEQ, the company refers to an &#8220;unexpected and unavoidable equipment malfunction&#8221; that occurred at about 10:37 p.m. on Feb. 12.</p>



<p>Weston County Emergency Management Coordinator Gilbert Nelson, who has been briefed by the company multiple times since the incident, told WyoFile, &#8220;They were just trying to restart the heater and it went boom.&#8221;</p>



<p>Par Pacific is studying what happened to cause the heater failure, Scholes said. &#8220;Anytime an incident occurs, we&#8217;re all hands on deck to come do an investigation to look for lessons learned that we can apply to any of our other facilities.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oil and gas refineries can be a dangerous profession,&#8221; Scholes added. &#8220;Things can go wrong, and we live every day doing everything we can to make sure that they don&#8217;t. And we were just incredibly lucky, and we developed new systems. We do new checks. This is not something anybody wants to see repeated, so you can bet that we will do everything we can to make sure it doesn&#8217;t happen again.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the days following, the company&#8217;s public updates noted a lingering cold snap and notified locals that they would likely see more steam than usual as crews used boilers to try to keep equipment from freezing. &#8220;It was 20 below zero when all this was going on,&#8221; Scholes told WyoFile.</p>



<p>The company also notified residents there would be more flaring than usual. Refineries frequently burn residual petrol vapors to reduce their hazardous effects, resulting in a flame at the top of a stack. Later, the refinery asked the state for permission, which was granted, to use a temporary boiler to prevent equipment from freezing, state documents show.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>History of incidents</strong></h4>



<p>The refinery is situated just south of West Main Street and a half-mile from Newcastle High School. The refinery was established in 1927, and officials are quick to point out that it was the <a href="https://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/newcastle-wyoming?utm_source=chatgpt.com">town</a> — at the edge of the Black Hills with a population of about 3,300 — that grew around it.</p>



<p>Par Pacific, which also operates refineries in Hawaii, Billings, Montana and Tacoma, Washington, acquired the facility in 2016.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Under a previous owner in the 2000s, Denver-based Hermes Consolidated, Inc., the refinery was known for <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyo-refineries/">a series of mishaps</a>, including a March 2002 spill that rained 20 tons of silica catalyst over a portion of the town, resulting in a 2008 settlement with 47 Newcastle-area residents. Details of the settlement were not disclosed. In the latter part of that decade, the refinery received nine “notices of violation” from Wyoming DEQ, resulting in $427,400 in civil penalties.</p>



<p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency also took action against the refinery at the time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The company paid a civil penalty of $150,000 in 2009 and agreed to invest $14 million in upgrades to settle several alleged emission violations cited by the EPA. In 2010, Wyoming Refining paid a $157,500 penalty to the EPA for “failure to prepare, submit, and implement an adequate and complete Facility Response Plan.”</p>





<p>Scholes said Par Pacific prioritizes safety and environmental compliance. &#8220;We have certain standards at Par that may not have been there before, and we are constantly working to improve operations.&#8221;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/DEQ-2023-inspect-report-Wyo-Refinery.pdf">2023 Wyoming DEQ inspection report</a>, the most recent available, determined, &#8220;There were no noted concerns during these inspections.&#8221; The inspection report also listed the refinery as being in &#8220;substantial compliance.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The safety of our workers and the community is our No. 1 priority,&#8221; Scholes said. &#8220;We&#8217;re very proud of our employees that live in the Newcastle community, and they stepped up. They did great work in bringing this facility back to where it can eventually get fully online.&#8221;<br><br>From 2017 to 2022, Wyoming&#8217;s overall oil refining capacity shrank by 27% — from 177,500 barrels per day to 125,850, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/PET_PNP_CAP1_DCU_SWY_A.htm">according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration</a>. The state went from five oil refineries to four in 2021 when HollyFrontier Sinclair converted its Cheyenne oil refinery to produce “renewable diesel,” which uses agricultural products — not oil — to produce the fuel.</p>

<p>Gov. Mark Gordon recently joined several Wyoming business proprietors at a trade show in Taiwan, where Casper-based Backwards Distilling Company and Gillette-based Big Lost Meadery are highly regarded and very popular, he said. But the popularity of Wyoming spirits wasn’t the main thrust of the visit.</p>



<p>In both Taiwan and Japan, Gordon and other Wyoming dignitaries visited with business and ministry officials who are interested in Wyoming&#8217;s coal and natural gas, as well as strengthening partnerships to push carbon capture technologies to help those fossil fuels fit within their low-carbon-emission goals.</p>



<p>Both potential markets rely heavily on energy fuel imports, Gordon said, while officials in Taiwan believe that &#8220;about 20% of their energy mix is going to remain with coal and they&#8217;re very anxious to get Powder River coal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Taiwan has its own elected government, but the People&#8217;s Republic of China claims it has sovereignty over the island off its coast.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gordon called a press conference Wednesday to highlight his trade mission to the region earlier this month. He was joined by officials from the University of Wyoming, Wyoming Energy Authority as well as representatives from energy producers Jonah Energy, Williams Companies and coal-to-products company Kanata Clean Power &amp; Climate Technologies Corp.</p>



<p>&#8220;It builds confidence, which is very important in Asia,&#8221; Gordon said of the international talks. &#8220;And so this leads us to believe that there is a lot of very exciting opportunity.&#8221;</p>



<p>One primary tangible outcome Gordon hopes to come of strengthening ties with the two foreign markets is to reinvigorate efforts to build coal and natural gas port terminals to increase the international export of those Wyoming commodities. While the U.S. has increased its capacity to export liquified natural gas, efforts to expand coal ports, particularly on the West Coast, have faltered for years.</p>



<p>But Gordon believes that with public-private investment, along with policy support from President Donald Trump, those efforts will be revitalized.</p>



<p>It will require &#8220;looking at whether the Millennium Bulk Terminal can be reinvigorated, or Jordan Cove [terminal] or whether a couple of these other things in Oakland that have been talked about from time to time could come to fruition,&#8221; Gordon said. Increasing Wyoming&#8217;s fossil fuel exports might also require &#8220;going out of the Gulf of America [Gulf of Mexico] and going through the Panama Canal,&#8221; he added.</p>

<p>Asked whether the state&#8217;s trade efforts might help the beleaguered Kemmerer coal mine land export contracts in time to save it from potentially closing, Gordon said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a silver bullet for that right now. But I can tell you, I&#8217;m rummaging around in my ammo box for it.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Carbon capture hopes and Kemmerer coal</strong></h4>



<p>Kemmerer Operations LLC <a href="https://wyofile.com/kemmerer-coal-mine-lays-off-28-workers/">recently laid off 28 workers</a>, and many in southwest Wyoming worry there may be more job losses, or that <a href="https://wyofile.com/coal-layoffs-leave-wyoming-community-grappling-with-good-bad-of-energy-transition/">the mine might even close</a>.</p>



<p>The mine’s biggest customer — the nearby Naughton power plant, which accounts for about 42% of the mine’s coal production, according to federal documents — will stop burning coal by the end of the year as its owner, PacifiCorp, converts the plant to natural gas fuel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There remains a mix of hope and skepticism for two proposals to tap the Kemmerer coal mine for coal-to-products projects — potentially making up for the pending loss of the Naughton coal contract. In fact, an official from <a href="https://kanataclean.com/">Kanata Clean Power &amp; Climate Technologies Corp.</a> joined Gordon on the Japan and Taiwan trade mission.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="567" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?resize=780%2C567&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-112575" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?resize=1024%2C744&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?resize=768%2C558&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?resize=400%2C291&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Naughton-and-mine-March-2025-DBleizeffer-1024x744.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The Naughton coal-fired power plant and neighboring Kemmerer mine in western Wyoming. (Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The company proposes a multi-billion-dollar effort to cleanly convert about 1.8 million tons of Kemmerer coal annually into ammonia, primarily as an agricultural fertilizer. Another company, <a href="https://www.trisightglobal.com/about-us">TriSight LLC</a>, claims to have &#8220;unlocked&#8221; a process to convert the coal into myriad products, including graphite, agricultural fertilizer and makeup — using about 1 million tons per year from the Kemmerer mine, all while avoiding coal&#8217;s typical carbon emissions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But neither project appears on the Wyoming Industrial Siting Council&#8217;s <a href="https://deq.wyoming.gov/industrial-siting-2/council/">working list of applications</a> — a required regulatory step for such projects. Taken at face value, the lack of an ISC permit application indicates that neither proposal is likely to consume Kemmerer coal within the next year or so.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Wyoming coal-to-ammonia project team is evaluating multiple siting alternatives, a list of alternatives that includes the Kemmerer mine surface lease,&#8221; F.E. “Wally” Wolski, who works with Kanata, told WyoFile via email.</p>





<p>Although WyoFile has not fully investigated the financial preparedness of either TriSight or Kanata, some southwest Wyoming officials regard both coal-to-products proposals as a potential lifeline for the mine. Kemmerer City Administrator Brian Muir told WyoFile that both projects underscore signs of a potential rebound in the coal market and the potential for technologies to find new uses for coal.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is not over yet,&#8221; Muir told WyoFile in March. &#8220;There&#8217;s years and years of coal reserves here, and technologies to convert [coal into products].&#8221;</p>



<p>Among the most exciting topics discussed on his trade mission to Japan and Taiwan, Gordon said, was an agreement to support coal technologies that reduce its carbon footprint.</p>



<p>&#8220;[We talked] about the progression of technologies that could go forward, and that generated a lot of excitement,&#8221; Gordon said.</p>

<p>Wyoming’s Bureau of Land Management state director has been placed on administrative leave after a federal investigation found he violated ethics regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andrew Archuleta accepted a gift of dinner and drinks, misused his assistant’s time when he asked her to make travel arrangements for his girlfriend and drove his girlfriend to and from Buffalo in a government vehicle — all in violation of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ARCHULETA-BLM.pdf">according to a February investigation summary from the Office of Inspector General.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Archuleta was placed on leave in April, BLM Wyoming Senior Advisor Brad Purdy confirmed Wednesday. Kris Kirby has been named acting state director, Purdy said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Archuleta was selected to helm the state’s BLM office in January 2022. In the position, he has overseen the management of 17.5 million surface acres of public lands and more than 40 million acres of federal sub-surface mineral lands. He directed an office with more than 600 permanent staff and 150 seasonal employees who help manage everything from energy development and livestock grazing to campgrounds, multi-use trails, outdoor recreation spots and wild horses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He occupied the spot during a time of tumult and national attention. The 2023 release of the draft Rock Springs Field Office Resource Management Plan sparked furor and heated debate over how to manage some 3.6 million acres of public lands in southwestern Wyoming. <a href="https://wyofile.com/biden-administration-finalizes-rock-springs-plan-without-further-changes/">The plan</a> spurred <a href="https://wyofile.com/after-public-furor-task-force-offers-guidance-on-blms-plan-for-sw-wyoming/">state intervention</a>, drew thousands of comments and triggered fierce criticism of the federal government by elected officials and others.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gifts, travel, rental cars</strong></h4>



<p>The Office of Inspector General investigated allegations that Archuleta may have violated the ethical conduct standards when he “accepted a gift of dinner and drinks at a Cheyenne, Wyoming, steakhouse from the owner of a commercial sign manufacturing company,” according to the investigation summary.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Investigators found that he was in violation in that matter, according to the summary. They also determined Archuleta misused his subordinate’s time when he asked his assistant to make air travel arrangements on the clock for his girlfriend to accompany him on official travel, the summary states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In addition, we determined that Archuleta misused a Government rental vehicle in violation of DOI policy when he allowed his girlfriend to drive the rental vehicle and that he violated the Federal Travel Regulation when he used the Government rental car for personal purposes,” the summary continues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, investigators found Archuleta violated policy when he drove his girlfriend to and from Buffalo in a government vehicle “because she was neither a Federal employee nor conducting official Government business there.”&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Background&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Archuleta’s career in federal service stretches back three decades, according to a BLM press release that announced his 2022 selection. His former assignments include BLM Colorado’s Northwest District manager and district manager for BLM’s California Desert District. He has also worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service.</p>



<p>“His understanding of rural communities and the challenges they face coupled with the expertise he has developed will continue to benefit the BLM and the Wyoming communities and constituencies we serve,” former BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning said in the 2022 announcement.</p>



<p>Archuleta, a Colorado native, earned both a bachelor’s degree in wildlife biology and a master’s degree in wildlife toxicology from Colorado State University. He is an avid outdoorsman, according to the BLM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Purdy could not comment on further action or future steps regarding Archuleta’s position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WyoFile was unable to contact Archuleta on Wednesday for comment.</p>

<p>CHEYENNE—A silver triangle rang out 45 times in the Capitol&#8217;s rotunda. Each ring commemorated a worker who went to work in Wyoming in 2023 and didn&#8217;t return home to their families because they were killed on the job.</p>



<p>About three dozen people — mostly from local unions — gathered for the Workers Memorial Day ceremony on a cool and wet Monday evening.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every person who goes to work deserves to come home,&#8221; said Marcie Kindred, executive director of the Wyoming AFL-CIO. &#8220;Every family deserves the peace of knowing their loved ones are protected. Every life lost is one too many.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Rev. Delaney Piper, pastor of Highlands Presbyterian Church, led the group in prayer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh God, we do not understand why deaths like this, that we remember, that we mourn today, occur,&#8221; Piper said. &#8220;More so, we do not understand why everyone — workers, business leaders and political leaders — don&#8217;t just join in taking decisive action to prevent future deaths and to protect workers.&#8221;</p>

<p>The annual event recognizes Workers Memorial Day, the anniversary of the 1970 <a href="https://www.osha.gov/laws-regs/oshact/completeoshact">Occupational Safety and Health Act</a>. The measure, in response to the carnage of workplace fatalities, injuries and illnesses, is supposed to ensure safe work conditions. Though accidents do happen, Kindred said, far too many are entirely preventable and, collectively, they point to a systemic disregard for workers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Behind every workplace fatality lies a story [of a life] cut short too soon and a ripple of grief that continues long after the headlines fade,&#8221; Kindred said.</p>



<p>Kindred and other speakers noted that Wyoming&#8217;s 45 occupational fatalities in 2023 made it <a href="https://wyofile.com/labor-advocates-most-lethal-state-in-the-nation-for-workers-ignores-blue-collar-plight/">the deadliest state in the nation for workers</a> that year — a distinction Wyoming has held far too many times. Marcia Shanor, executive director of the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and a longtime worker advocate, said the annual commitment to demand safer working conditions appears to ring hollow among state leaders.</p>

<p>&#8220;We have committed, every single year for the last 20 years, to do better,&#8221; Shanor said. &#8220;And here we are, 20 years later, decades later, with one of the highest workplace fatality rates since 2007. It feels hollow to have to say those words that I have said every single year as we have remembered the great people who keep our state working.&#8221;</p>



<p>United Steelworkers Local 13214 President Marshal Cummings, who works at the WE Soda trona mine near Green River, believes Wyoming&#8217;s perpetual worker fatality epidemic is the result of a disregard for workers enshrined in its &#8220;<a href="https://law.justia.com/codes/wyoming/title-27/chapter-7/">right-to-work</a>&#8221; laws. Such laws ostensibly protect employees from being forced to join a union. But, in Cummings&#8217; estimation, the laws are specifically intended to limit the power of unions, along with their persuasion to hold employers accountable for worker safety.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s be very clear about this: right-to-work is a lie,&#8221; Cummings said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about jobs. It&#8217;s not about freedom. It&#8217;s about weakening the very organizations — our unions — that keep us safe.&#8221;</p>



<p>In states with right-to-work laws, workers see lower wages, fewer health benefits and weaker retirement security, according to Cummings.</p>



<p>&#8220;Most importantly, workplaces [in right-to-work states] are more dangerous,&#8221; he said. &#8220;What is the right to liberty if you can&#8217;t speak up on dangerous conditions because you might be fired if you do? What&#8217;s the right to personal happiness if you&#8217;re trapped in a system where your work, your blood, your sweat, your tears, if your sacrifice is treated as disposable?&#8221;</p>





<p>For now, the Wyoming AFL-CIO is focusing its legislative efforts not on the state&#8217;s right-to-work laws, but on the larger and more immediate goal of improving workplace safety, according to Kindred. The union group, the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association and other worker advocates see an opportunity to reignite past statewide efforts that had nudged Wyoming toward safer workplaces — efforts that seemed to fizzle out after the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>



<p>&#8220;It shouldn&#8217;t be one time a year that we all get together and talk about why this is an important issue,&#8221; Shanor said. &#8220;We should be having those conversations at the workplace, upstairs [in the House and Senate chambers], the governor&#8217;s office, and we should have leadership by our elected officials in helping us actually make steps forward that stay in place.&#8221;</p>

<p>As the Department of the Interior develops a plan to “restore American prosperity” by exploiting Western natural resources, a Wyoming attorney who has steeled rural communities against federal policies is atop the hierarchy that will marshal the effort.</p>



<p>Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum last month <a href="https://www.doi.gov/document-library/secretary-order/so-3414-a5-amendment-so-3414-establishment-new-department">appointed</a> Karen Budd-Falen as temporary deputy secretary and his senior advisor. As the department fleshes out a four-year strategic plan to use natural resources across <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R42346.pdf">19.9 million acres</a> of national parks and Bureau of Land Management property in Wyoming, Budd-Falen will be in the Interior’s second-highest position.</p>



<p>A draft of the <a href="https://www.publicdomain.media/p/interior-trump-draft-strategic-plan?utm_source=Master%2BPress%2BList%2B2.0&amp;utm_campaign=8df86253dc-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_04_23_04_19&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-8df86253dc-84285649">four-year Interior plan</a> leaked to Public Domain outlines department objectives for prosperity, security and recreation. Conservationists have decried elements they say would dismantle environmental safeguards, turn over federal property, promote energy development and favor rural communities over nationwide interests.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“It is irresponsible for a media outlet to publish a draft document.” </p><cite>Department of the Interior<br></cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>The Interior Department last week blasted the leak and called its publication “irresponsible.”</p>



<p>“It is beyond unacceptable that an internal document in the draft/deliberative process is being shared with the media before a decision point has been made,” Interior’s press office wrote WyoFile on Thursday. “Not only is this unacceptable behavior, it is irresponsible for a media outlet to publish a draft document.</p>



<p>“We will take this leak of an internal, pre-decisional document very seriously and find out who is responsible,” the statement reads.</p>



<p>The draft plan, which the agency said is “not final nor ready for release,” sets four goals and several objectives to accomplish them. Interior’s drafted goals are to restore American prosperity, ensure national security through infrastructure and innovation, and allow sustainable enjoyment of natural resources. It would do all that through the fourth goal — collaboration with states, tribes and local governments.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>American prosperity</strong></h4>



<p>The draft plan to restore American prosperity would use American energy to “lower… costs and increases affordability.” But it includes elements that worry conservationists who fear damage to Interior agencies including the National Park Service, BLM, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and Bureau of Indian Affairs.</p>



<p>The plan would “deregulate” to increase “clean coal” production and oil and gas drilling. It would streamline the National Environmental Policy Act, a law designed to safeguard the environment. And it would reduce the cost of grazing, which critics say is already too low.</p>

<p>The draft would “release federal holdings” — divest Americans of their public property — to allow states and communities to reduce housing costs. Interior would support agriculture and increase revenues from logging, non-energy mining, and grazing. The draft treats natural resources as assets, viewing federal holdings for the economic value that can be derived from them.</p>



<p>The leaked document “reads like an industry wish list,” the <a href="https://westernpriorities.org/">Center for Western Priorities</a> said in a statement. It includes “a thinly veiled reference to the seizure and sale of public lands,” according to the conservation group.</p>



<p>The draft treats the West’s natural resources “as nothing more than numbers on a balance sheet,” Western Priorities Executive Director Jennifer Rokala said in a statement. In the plan, those resources are “products to be sold off and exploited to help pay for tax cuts for Elon Musk and Trump&#8217;s fellow billionaires,” she said.</p>



<p>“It resembles a business plan from a desperate CEO, not a framework to steward public lands for the benefit of all Americans,” Rokala’s statement reads.</p>

<p>To her post, Budd-Falen brings years of experience fighting for ranchers and other public land users and developers. The federal government has been a frequent adversary, but so has <a href="https://www.westernwatersheds.org/about/">Western Watersheds Project</a>, another conservation group that focuses on public land grazing.</p>



<p>She represented a group of ranchers who <a href="https://wyofile.com/water-war-continues-despite-court-settlement/">sued Western Watersheds</a> for trespassing when a field worker collected water to test for pollution caused by grazing. She <a href="https://wyofile.com/budd-falen-provocateur-protector/">advised rural counties</a> to adopt land use plans they could leverage when contesting federal programs on public land in their areas. She also represented stock growers who <a href="https://wyofile.com/stock-growers-judge-in-corner-crossing-case-misunderstood-new-trespass-law/">sided against</a> four Missouri hunters who corner crossed to hunt public land on Elk Mountain in Carbon County. She represented the Cliven Bundy family and others as they fought grazing reductions imposed after Las Vegas developers were permitted to occupy desert tortoise habitat. That family later became infamous for armed standoffs with federal officials over use of public land.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conservation measures</strong></h4>



<p>The draft plan includes numerous other elements like supporting law enforcement, disseminating science and managing lands to reduce wildfire risk. It would reduce the federal infrastructure footprint and ensure public lands meet visitors’ needs. The draft envisions clean and adequate amounts of water.</p>



<p>Interior would restore historic names, some of which have been changed to recognize indigenous monikers or demote racist figures. The department would “right size” national monuments, according to the draft.</p>





<p>A goal to “enjoy our natural resources while ensuring they remain sound and sustainable,” includes a variety of conservation measures, according to the draft. Species and natural resources would be protected and ecosystems would be healthy and balanced, the draft said. Progress could be measured by the number of species taken off threatened and endangered lists, according to the draft.</p>



<p>Abandoned mines and wells would be cleaned up, the draft proposes. The department would support co-management of its properties with “local stakeholders and tribes,” the draft states.</p>



<p>Burgum appointed Budd-Falen “to facilitate the prompt and effective accession of the Trump administration’s leadership team,” his order states. She will serve until the Senate confirms high Interior Department personnel appointed by President Trump, but no longer than through May 31.</p>



<p>The timeline for public engagement is from May 16 to July 18, with publication, or final adoption, set for Oct. 1. The strategic plan is a “bold, outcome-driven roadmap for how we deliver impact to the American people,” the draft states.</p>

<p>In 2023, a worker died after falling through a skylight on a construction job. Another died after being thrown from a front-end loader. Yet another was buried in a trench collapse and two were crushed by vehicles they were either inspecting or repairing at the time, according to the <a href="https://dws.wyo.gov/dws-division/osha/fatal-accident-alerts/">Wyoming Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#8217;s fatal accident alerts website</a>.</p>



<p>The five &#8220;alerts&#8221; — limited to two sentences or less — belie the actual extent of occupational fatalities in Wyoming that year. Forty-five workers died on the job in 2023 — a 32.4% increase over the previous year and the deadliest since 2007, <a href="https://doe.state.wy.us/lmi/CFOI/toc.htm">according to the state&#8217;s most recent annual report</a> on workplace fatalities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unless a <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/cops_courts/local/md-nursery-fined-for-mans-trench-death/article_e6c872b8-484b-11ef-804d-9bd23d4c70e4.html">local newsroom reports</a> on a workplace fatality, or there&#8217;s civil litigation, most victims&#8217; names disappear into the maw of multiple bureaucracies where extracting the type of information that might point to problem areas and potential solutions is frustratingly difficult, advocates and officials say.</p>



<p>“These aren’t just statistics — they’re our neighbors, family members and fellow Wyomingites,” Wyoming AFL-CIO Executive Director Marcie Kindred said in a prepared statement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today is <a href="https://aflcio.org/about-us/conferences-and-events/workers-memorial-day">Workers Memorial Day</a>. Workers and their advocates <a href="https://www.mobilize.us/wyomingaflcio/event/775353/?referring_vol=10322276&amp;share_context=dashboard-event-details&amp;sharer_role=2">will gather at the steps of the Capitol</a> in Cheyenne beginning at 5:30 p.m. to commemorate the dozens of lives lost each year while on the job in Wyoming. The workplace tragedies are not only preventable but so frequent that Wyoming has ranked the worst or among the worst in the nation — on a per-capita basis — for decades, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/iif/state-data/fatal-injury-rates-by-state-2007-2023.htm">federal data</a>.</p>



<p>The state doesn&#8217;t appear to be on track to shed its deadly distinction.</p>



<p>Last year was comparably deadly, though there&#8217;s no official tally yet, and at least four workers have died on the job so far this year, according to Wyoming OSHA. They include: David Wesley Moore, 58, of Douglas, <a href="https://www.douglas-budget.com/news/article_99ac92d4-df81-11ef-8797-efe20024ffe0.html">killed in a natural gas compressor station fire</a> in Converse County; Alexander Harsha, 22, of Rock Springs, hit by a door that was struck by a forklift in Sweetwater County; Liam Cobb, 19, of Casper, <a href="https://www.douglas-budget.com/news/article_35ef5422-11cf-4497-91a6-c910dad5974b.html">died by suicide, falling from a wind tower</a> in Carbon County; and Denice Downing, 47, of Gillette, killed in a <a href="https://www.gillettenewsrecord.com/news/local/article_6d33a3f7-c880-41d7-9aa7-c6fa38d1c180.html">tanker-truck explosion</a> in Campbell County.</p>



<p>“Year after year, we gather [on Workers Memorial Day] to honor those we’ve lost, yet we see no meaningful improvement in workplace safety,&#8221; Kindred said. &#8220;We need concrete action to protect Wyoming’s workers.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite the state&#8217;s December report confirming yet another notch to Wyoming&#8217;s dishonor as the &#8220;deadliest,&#8221; it doesn&#8217;t appear that the carnage — including the hardships families face — is a priority among elected officials. Past state-level initiatives, along with some industry-led safety efforts, seem to have fallen by the wayside, advocates say. Rather than a call to action to understand how to make Wyoming workplaces safer, Kindred said, worker advocates had to fight this year to defeat a <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/SF0175">measure</a> to reduce unemployment benefits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kindred said she recently told union members: &#8220;Your elected officials spent your taxpayer dollars arguing about pronouns and bathrooms. Meanwhile, we&#8217;re dying out here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Each year, the Wyoming AFL-CIO, along with the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, pleads with lawmakers to take on the worker fatality crisis as an interim topic, and each year, legislative leadership declines.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we value workers in Wyoming like we should,&#8221; said Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association Executive Director Marcia Shanor, who has advocated for workplace safety for decades. &#8220;If we did, we would never tolerate 45 people being killed without asking about it.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s driving the crisis?</strong></h4>



<p>The 45 occupational fatalities in 2023 made Wyoming the most lethal state in the nation for workers on a per-capita basis — by a long shot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyoming recorded 16 fatalities per 100,000 workers, according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/iif/state-data/fatal-injury-rates-by-state-and-industry-2023.htm">the most recent federal data available</a>. North Dakota was second at 9.8 deaths per 100,000 workers, and Mississippi followed at 6.9 deaths per 100,000 workers.</p>

<p>Agriculture, ranching and forestry were among the most deadly work sectors, according to the <a href="https://doe.state.wy.us/lmi/CFOI/toc.htm">state&#8217;s annual report</a>, followed by mining and oil and natural gas extraction. Across all industries, highway crashes and vehicular accidents accounted for 67% of all occupational fatalities in 2023.</p>



<p>At face value, workplace fatalities can appear to be &#8220;random&#8221; from year to year, according to Wyoming OSHA Program Manager Christian Graham. It&#8217;s tempting, he said, to point to Wyoming&#8217;s often-hazardous driving conditions, or unregulated ranch work, or employees shirking safety protocols.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s so many instances where sometimes these can be prevented if we just slow down and pay attention,&#8221; Graham said.</p>



<p>Yet, it&#8217;s difficult to derive from data what exactly is behind Wyoming&#8217;s worker fatality problem, Graham cautioned. The labor, safety and workforce regulatory world is full of reductive reports and databases that, individually, don&#8217;t reveal root causes or how to address them. To understand and effectively address what plagues workplace safety, Graham said, requires deep, ongoing analysis and interaction with employers and employees. Wyoming OSHA and the Wyoming Department of Workforce Services do have those conversations with both employers and employees, he said. The agencies also oversee <a href="https://dws.wyo.gov/dws-division/osha/safety-health-consultation-compliance-assistance/">multiple programs</a> that go beyond inspections and enforcement to provide services such as safety training and voluntary consultations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&#8220;One death is too many,&#8221; Graham said, adding that more resources are always welcome. &#8220;We do our best while we&#8217;re out there to present our programs, and we&#8217;re completing our inspections throughout the state.&#8221;</p>



<p>Though workplace inspections and training programs are vital, the state does not do enough to hold employers accountable, Kindred said. She bristles when people chalk up the state&#8217;s track record to vehicle accidents and on-the-job suicides and homicides — which are included in the state&#8217;s tally.</p>



<p>&#8220;We also have the highest rates of suicide in the nation, and that&#8217;s a workers&#8217; issue,&#8221; Kindred said. &#8220;If they&#8217;re doing it on the job, these are deaths of despair because they&#8217;re at this job they hate that doesn&#8217;t pay enough and they can&#8217;t support their families.</p>



<p>&#8220;And if a lot of these [vehicle fatalities] are out-of-state truckers,&#8221; Kindred added, &#8220;we need to make sure they&#8217;re prepared. We need to be better neighbors. If people are sending their workers to Wyoming and they&#8217;re dying, that&#8217;s not the reputation we want.&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s always a desire to pin the blame on workers for taking short cuts or not following procedures without acknowledging the pressures they&#8217;re under and things they don&#8217;t have control over, like improperly maintained equipment or the right tools for the job, said Tyson Logan, a partner at the Spence Law Firm, which specializes in workers&#8217; rights.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="520" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?resize=780%2C520&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-67877" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?resize=450%2C300&amp;ssl=1 450w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/RonMorgan.jpeg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Ron Morgan stands for a portrait in front of his truck on March 21, 2020.

<p>&#8220;We see it all the time,&#8221; Logan said. &#8220;Wyoming workers are going out to do their job and being killed because of corporate negligence or recklessness. And what we see again and again is that companies just aren&#8217;t making their workers&#8217; safety a priority.&#8221;</p>



<p>Most employers provide proper training and equipment and encourage a culture of safety, Logan said, noting a slow cultural shift over decades.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s daunting, though. The problem is it&#8217;s not every company or every job,&#8221; he said. &#8220;When the economy is not as strong, companies tend to take more risks. When there&#8217;s fewer people, there&#8217;s more expectations and trying to do more with less. That&#8217;s when people get hurt.&#8221;</p>



<p>There are myriad inherent on-the-job risks in Wyoming, including long commutes to remote locations and working around heavy equipment, said Rep. Lee Filer, a Republican from Cheyenne who owns a company that builds and operates data centers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Every bit of the equipment they&#8217;re running, none of it is forgiving,&#8221; Filer said. &#8220;If it&#8217;s a forklift or front-end loader, that&#8217;s thousands of pounds hitting you. So it doesn&#8217;t take much.&#8221;</p>



<p>Despite embracing safe workplace practices while serving in the military and as a union representative with the railroad, Filer admits he lost a fingertip to a saw blade due to his own recklessness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did it myself,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I do the best I can to make sure that my crew is safe. I always tell them, &#8216;Come let me know if you have a concern,&#8217; because I don&#8217;t want anybody getting hurt. And I&#8217;ve been pretty successful with that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Too many workers, however, feel they&#8217;re under pressure and don&#8217;t speak up, he said. His biggest worry is worker fatigue and commuting to and from work.</p>



<p>&#8220;It could be mandatory overtime issues where people maybe work 12 hours, 16 hours, then have to drive home,&#8221; Filer said. &#8220;Wyoming is always going to have a bad rap on this because of our shift work. A lot of our industries — the coal mines and railroads — those places are 24/7 operations.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>What&#8217;s being done about it?</strong></h4>



<p>Beginning in the 2000s, a spike in fatalities and injuries that coincided with a coalbed methane and natural gas drilling boom spurred advocates like the Wyoming Trial Lawyers Association, Wyoming AFL-CIO and the Equality State Policy Center to increase pressure on leaders in Cheyenne.</p>



<p>The response wasn&#8217;t immediate. But eventually, the state organized special hearings and there was a genuine statewide discussion about how to make workplaces safer, according to Shanor, who played a key advocacy role. Industries responded, too, forming the <a href="https://dws.wyo.gov/wogisa-to-offer-leadership-training-in-casper-and-rock-springs/">Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance</a>, the <a href="https://dws.wyo.gov/dws-division/osha/osha-alliance/">Wyoming Transportation Safety Coalition</a> and a new safety training center in Casper.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="446" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?resize=780%2C446&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-51950" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?resize=300%2C172&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?resize=768%2C439&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?resize=728%2C416&amp;ssl=1 728w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?resize=745%2C426&amp;ssl=1 745w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Lee-Mosser-WC-hearing.jpg?w=400&amp;ssl=1 400w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Casper resident Lee Mosser (far right) testifies at a hearing with his attorney Hampton Young (center), while attorney Amy Taheri represents Wyoming Workers&#8217; Compensation in 2016.

<p>There were even modest reforms — which were hard-fought, Shanor said — such as an annual cost-of-living adjustment and an increase in death benefits under the Wyoming Workers&#8217; Compensation program. The Legislature in 2014 <a href="https://wyofile.com/lawmaker-time-consider-stiffer-osha-penalties/">considered increasing fines and penalties</a> for egregious safety violations to dissuade what some referred to as a &#8220;<a href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/issue-343/disposable-workers-of-the-oil-and-gas-fields/">disposable worker</a>&#8221; attitude among some employers in the region. The state even created an occupational epidemiologist position at Wyoming Workforce Services to not only analyze workplace fatality and injury data, but to coordinate information among multiple, siloed agencies that investigate worker fatalities to help identify strategies to do something about it.</p>



<p>The drive to finally address Wyoming&#8217;s workplace fatality epidemic, however, petered out, Shanor said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Wyoming Oil and Gas Industry Safety Alliance is no longer active, according to Wyoming OSHA, and the Wyoming Transportation Safety Coalition is trying to regain footing. The state recently reclassified the occupational epidemiologist post to an &#8220;OSHA compliance assistance position,&#8221; which means the state is no longer performing the deep analysis of root causes like it had in the past.</p>



<p>OSHA defended the changes as enhancing “our ability to support health and safety throughout the state by guiding rule and standard development, conducting outreach, and being an accessible resource.”</p>



<p>But Shanor, the workforce safety advocate, doesn’t see it that way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a huge loss,&#8221; she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I just think we lack leadership,&#8221; she added. &#8220;I worry that maybe we let them off the hook after COVID.&#8221;</p>

(Wyoming AFL-CIO)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Kindred, of the AFL-CIO, was more blunt.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Wyoming leaders] like to talk about our work ethic and how we love our workers; We get the job done and we don&#8217;t complain,&#8221; Kindred said. &#8220;But when it comes time to put our policies and our efforts where our mouth is, we just want workers to be our mascot. We don&#8217;t really want to support them in any way.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s disheartening, Kindred added, because Wyoming really is the place where people will pull over to help a stranger broken down on the side of the road. &#8220;That&#8217;s why our continued inaction on workplace safety is so jarring. It contradicts our fundamental values.&#8221;</p>



<p>Filer, who served on the Labor, Health and Social Services Committee during his first stint in the House of Representatives from 2013 to 2014, said he&#8217;s seen a shift in the Legislature from solving Wyoming problems to adhering to ideology.</p>



<p>&#8220;Worker safety, to me, is not an ideology or political position,&#8221; Filer said. &#8220;It&#8217;s something that everybody can probably agree on — that everybody wants to come home to their family when they get off work.&#8221;</p>





<p>Filer said he&#8217;s in favor of asking for more detailed reports, analysis and ideas from Wyoming Workforce Services and Wyoming OSHA, and generally prioritizing the workplace fatality epidemic at the Legislature. While he&#8217;s adamantly opposed to regulations, some are necessary, like &#8220;OSHA laws,&#8221; Filer said. &#8220;There&#8217;s a reason those [laws] are on the books. It&#8217;s because they were written in blood.&#8221;</p>



<p>Transportation, Highways and Military Affairs Committee Co-Chair Rep. Landon Brown, a Republican from Cheyenne, said he wants the panel to take up the worker transportation safety issue this year.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Labor Committee co-chairs Sen. Eric Barlow of Gillette and Rep. Rachel Rodriguez-Williams of Cody, both Republicans, did not respond to WyoFile&#8217;s inquiry about whether the committee will take on the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Among the committee&#8217;s proposed topics this year, however, is to consider lowering — again — what employers pay into the workers&#8217; compensation program to &#8220;promote a more business-friendly environment&#8221; and &#8220;random&#8221; drug and alcohol testing of employees at state-funded institutions.</p>



<p>&#8220;It is time to reenergize this conversation and return worker safety to the forefront where it belongs,&#8221; Shanor said. &#8220;This silence is not just troubling; it is unacceptable.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>
