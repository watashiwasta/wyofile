<p>The majority of visitors to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks value wildlife viewing so much that they would support a park-related fee or tax toward habitat conservation, a new study finds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.70051">“Tradeoffs and win-wins between large landscape conservation and wildlife viewing in protected areas,”</a> was published Sunday in <em>Conservation Science and Practice. </em>Along with establishing support for paying conservation fees, the paper concludes that species population declines could have a greater effect on park visitation than imposing such fees.</p>



<p>“Visitors responded that they would be likely to visit the parks less if there were fewer wildlife to see,” said co-author Hilary Byerly Flint, a researcher with the University of Wyoming’s Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study looked specifically at Wyoming’s two northwestern national parks, and co-authors include Byerly Flint and Drew Bennett with the Haub School; migration researcher Arthur Middleton with the University of California, Berkeley; Leslie Richardson with the National Park Service’s economics program and Aaron Enriquez with the U.S. Geological Survey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authors say the study cements with data what many people already know: Seeing grizzly bears, elk, wolves or other animals in the wild is tremendously valuable to the public. So valuable that most would pony up to support conservation efforts beyond park boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For the vast majority of people who visit the parks, it&#8217;s mind blowing” to see something like an elk bugling, said Scott Christensen, executive director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, which helped fund the study. “It&#8217;s almost a once-in-a-lifetime experience for them, and it has real, tangible value.”</p>

<p>The concept of a conservation fee in national parks is not new, though it has yet to gain required federal traction to be enacted. Authors hope the study can be used to continue the dialogue, Byerly Flint said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we see this really as the start of a conversation about how to pay for conservation in these areas that are increasingly threatened,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re seeing the loss of habitat for these migratory ungulates at unprecedented rates,” Byerly Flint continued. And that leads to the question of: “How to pay for conservation of that habitat, while also maintaining the benefits and the wonderful experiences that park visitors enjoy when they come to Yellowstone and Grand Teton?”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Genesis</strong></h4>



<p>In 2018, former Wyoming State Rep. Al Sommers, a Sublette County rancher, sponsored a <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2018/HJ0005">joint resolution</a> relating to the collection of wildlife conservation fees at Yellowstone and Grand Teton. His resolution requested that the Department of the Interior and National Park Service enter into an agreement with Wyoming to collect a wildlife conservation fee at the parks to generate revenue for conservation efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Legislature passed the resolution, and Gov. Mark Gordon signed it, but those fees have not gained federal approval.</p>



<p>“My priority was conflict resolution,” Sommers told WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whether it’s grizzly bears or wolves, or elk or, frankly, wildlife on highways,” Sommers said, the fee was envisioned as “a way to generate money from all of the public, from the national public that enjoys these wildlife in the park, to help mitigate some of the cost associated with that and to ensure wildlife’s viability.”</p>



<p>Two years later, Middleton co-authored a paper titled <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.335">“Harnessing visitors&#8217; enthusiasm for national parks to fund cooperative large-landscape conservation,”</a> which further explored the concept. That study examined legal and political challenges and estimated that a fee of up to $10 per vehicle could generate up to $13 million annually for conservation projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new study takes the issue a step further, Byerly Flint said, by examining “what park visitors themselves think about the idea of contributing towards conservation and how important the animals that require habitat beyond park boundaries are to park visitor experiences.”</p>



<p>In summer 2022, a research assistant spent two months surveying visitors of Yellowstone and Grand Teton parks — both inside their boundaries and outside in communities like Jackson and Cody. </p>



<p>Researchers analyzed 991 responses. Just over 75% of respondents cited wildlife viewing as a primary reason for their trips to Yellowstone and Grand Teton. The majority also supported the idea of paying extra for conservation —&nbsp;with 93% supportive of a voluntary donation; 75% supportive of a tax or fee on goods and services; and 66% supportive of a mandatory wildlife conservation fee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study also found that wildlife viewing generates an estimated $581 million in annual recreational value in the two national parks, representing a significant economic engine. Yellowstone tallied 4.74 million visitations in 2024 — the second highest year on record. Grand Teton, meanwhile, reported 3.62 million, its third highest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly half of respondents, furthermore, said they would take fewer trips to the parks if there were fewer wide-ranging wildlife to view. That, researchers calculated, could result in about a 15% decrease in overall park visitation.</p>

<p>The results illustrate support for a basic trade off, the study concludes. Visitors are willing to pony up rather than risk long-term wildlife declines. </p>



<p>“These wide-ranging wildlife, like elk and mule deer and grizzly bears, are hugely important to park visitor experiences, to the reasons they decide to visit the parks,” Byerly Flint said.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Sommers’ resolution, along with a similar version passed in Montana, was nonbinding. Any change in park fees falls under the purview of the National Park Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyoming’s park superintendents have indicated support for wildlife, Byerly Flint noted. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly declined to comment for this story; Grand Teton Superintendent Chip Jenkins didn’t respond by publication time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Byerly Flint said, the paper underscores the point that “the value of the experience within the park boundaries is contingent upon what&#8217;s happening outside of park boundaries.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Support for a fee or donation was regardless of income or politics, the report found. In terms of diminishing returns, researchers found that a cost increase of more than $75 would equate to the same reduction in visits that might result from fewer wildlife to view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study does not mean the co-authors are set on fees as a solution, Byerly Flint said. “This is one way. This isn&#8217;t necessarily <em>the way. </em>It&#8217;s just an idea that we&#8217;re exploring.”</p>



<p>Christensen of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition echoed that sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every animal that spends time in the parks also spends time outside of the parks and in these unprotected areas,” he said. “And so our interest in this study is really around trying to come up with some innovative approaches for how to pay for conservation long term. I think what this study tells us, and gives us some hope around, is that people are willing to do that … there’s a willingness there.”</p>

<p>Grassy Wyoming roadsides can be enticing to grizzly bears, especially mothers with cubs, and many people can’t resist stopping to marvel at the charismatic critters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everybody wants to see a bear. That’s the picture you want to take home from your vacation,” said Wyoming Highway Patrol Sgt. Andy Jackson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stopping to view wildlife can be done safely, but in the heat of the moment, the trooper has written tickets to motorists for stopping in the middle of the road, leaving their car doors flung open and standing a hundred yards down the highway to take pictures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I ask them, ‘Would you do this where you live?’ And they go, ‘Well, no,’” Jackson said. “And I go, ‘Well why would you do it here?’”</p>



<p>As bears come out of hibernation, the snow melts and grass greens up along roadsides, Jackson and his colleagues with other local, state and federal agencies are gearing up to attempt to steer humans toward safer habits when it comes to viewing wildlife.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Togwotee Pass tees up a particularly vexing mix of grizzlies, wildlife watchers, steep grades, blind corners, high speeds and troubling behavior. Local, state and federal agencies put out a joint call last week for people to follow “ethical wildlife viewing and photography practices” on Togwotee Pass. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department and U.S. Forest Service have jointly stepped up patrols and are asking the public to heed their directions to minimize traffic jams and ensure safety for humans and bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent Steve Stoinski knows what a hazardous —&nbsp;and sometimes volatile — mix can be found on Togwotee Pass after <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/bye-felicia-hazing-isn-t-popular-or-pretty-but-it-s-keeping-celebrity-grizzly-away/article_17aaec9b-158f-581a-9c68-719053cc3057.html">spending the summer</a> of 2021 trying to solve the problem. Stoinski came out of retirement to work, under contract, for the Fish and Wildlife Service to intensively haze Grizzly 863, also known as Felicia, away from the roadside. Stoinski was already familiar with the grizzlies of Togwotee Pass, having previously investigated reports of drones harassing the federally protected threatened species. Although hazing briefly deterred the mother grizzly, Stoinski saw that it didn’t have a lasting effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The takeaways I had for managing grizzlies near the road,” he told WyoFile, “the bears are just going to hang out on the road.”</p>



<p><strong>Roadside bears</strong></p>



<p>Grizzlies have reasons to be <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/grizzly-399s-death-prompts-study-of-roadside-bear-watching/article_9cb48e1c-b1e8-11ef-921c-6b50d06ebc3c.html">next to the road</a>, whether to forage for food or for their own safety, he said. Male grizzlies tend to stay away from the highway, and female grizzlies tend to avoid male grizzlies to protect their cubs, he said. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/NadplQvQ/img_0688-2.mov"></video></figure>



<p>“I only saw one boar griz that whole summer,” Stoinski recalled. “At that time, Felicia, Bear 863, she headed out of that area as soon as she got wind of that bear and bolted across the highway. We had to stop traffic to get her across the highway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wildlife managers no longer have Bear 863 marked, according to Game and Fish Large Carnivore Supervisor Dan Thompson. Out of an abundance of caution, Thompson didn’t want to say for certain whether the sow and two cubs frequenting the Togwotee Pass area this spring are Felicia and her offspring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over the years, we’ve started to wonder if 863 has turned into a different bear that just likes the road,” Thompson told WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, there’s a sow with two cubs that frequents the area. Game and Fish caught and marked one of the cubs last summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We definitely have a bear that is very observable, and it’s unfortunate we have to go back every year and remind everybody [of] etiquette and ethics when it comes to viewing them,” Thompson said.&nbsp;</p>

Never approach bears. People should maintain a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife. (Jason Wilmot/U.S. Forest Service)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Ethical, and legal, viewing practices include not approaching bears, maintaining 100 yards between yourself and a bear, stopping in paved pullouts — not on the shoulder — and not feeding wildlife. Though Wyoming Highway Patrol typically responds to traffic complaints, they also get called to Togwotee Pass for confrontations over bear viewing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At times, some of the Game and Fish, some of the biologists, get harassed by the people that are bear watching,” Trooper Jackson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already this spring, Thompson said, “we’ve had some pretty nasty confrontations from some members of the public, basically telling us we can’t tell them what to do.”</p>



<p><strong>Human nature&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Those tensions motivated multiple agencies to come together to ask the public to follow directions from law enforcement and wildlife managers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stoinski also got an earful from bear watchers and photographers in 2021 when he hazed bears away from the road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They were pretty belligerent,” Stoinski <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/bye-felicia-hazing-isn-t-popular-or-pretty-but-it-s-keeping-celebrity-grizzly-away/article_17aaec9b-158f-581a-9c68-719053cc3057.html">said at the time</a>. “They got in our faces, were poking me in the chest.”</p>



<p>But eventually, they overcame those initial conflicts and worked together to promote bear and human safety, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bridger-Teton National Forest is leaning heavily into <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/r04/bridger-teton/newsroom/releases/agencies-call-upon-public-help-keep-bears-wild-and-people-safe">education and cooperation</a> to improve safety for bears and people on the highway, which is a <a href="https://dot.state.wy.us/files/live/sites/wydot/files/shared/Planning/Centennial%20Scenic%20Byway.pdf">designated scenic byway</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the <a href="https://bearwisejh.org/">Bear Wise Jackson Hole program</a> and other agency partners, the national forest is asking “the public, photographers, and wildlife tour groups to lead by example.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We get that there’s a lot of opportunities to see wildlife all over the forest,” Bridger-Teton spokeswoman Mary Cernicek said. As new vegetation sprouts along roadsides, attracting bears, “we’re so excited to see them and probably having unintended consequences.”</p>

(Bridger-Teton National Forest)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Originally, Togwotee didn’t see a heavy management presence along the highway, but as bear jams escalated, wildlife managers responded with attempts to change both bear and human behavior. Game and Fish still hazes grizzlies, when possible, away from the Togwotee highway.</p>



<p>“It’s been an ongoing effort to try to keep something worse from happening,” Thompson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it is Felicia along the road, she has been <a href="https://buckrail.com/explainer-what-to-do-in-the-event-of-a-wildlife-vehicle-collision-2/">hit by a car</a> before, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last fall, world-famous Grizzly 399 was <a href="https://wyofile.com/authorities-driver-hit-grizzly-399-while-going-speed-limit-killing-famous-bear-almost-instantly/">fatally struck</a> by a vehicle on the highway through the Snake River Canyon south of Jackson. The <a href="https://wyofile.com/grizzly-bear-399-struck-killed-by-vehicle-south-of-jackson/">matriarch bruin</a> had raised her cubs roadside in Grand Teton National Park for nearly two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Visitors save up and come from around the world to see Wyoming wildlife — a phenomenon not limited to national parks.</p>



<p><strong>Striking a balance&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In Wyoming, it’s illegal to park on the shoulder of a highway unless it’s an emergency, Trooper Jackson said, and people are supposed to use designated pullouts. But enforcing that law isn’t so easy.</p>



<p>He points to the hamlet of Wilson at the base of Teton Pass, where a moose can be seen most summer days from the shoulder of Highway 22.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All summer long, we get people stopping, taking a picture of the moose in Fish Creek,” Jackson said. Wyoming Highway Patrol fields frequent complaints from people who want the cars out of there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And I’m going, ‘These people came 2,000 miles to see this,’” Jackson said. “We try to have a good balance of what’s common sense.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Teton County Sheriff’s Office also enforces traffic laws and gets called to help out on Togwotee Pass. Sheriff Matt Carr said the county used to offer overtime pay to a deputy who lived in nearby Buffalo Valley to patrol the area more frequently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The key problem is people stopping,” Carr said. “It’s really not the tourists as much as it is the professional photographers.”</p>



<p>Carr said he no longer has that deputy or the budget to help as much as the county has in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re trying to watch budgets very seriously this year with the revenue losses we’re seeing from <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/town_county/facing-6-million-deficit-state-cuts-teton-county-mulls-increasing-property-taxes/article_244684e8-eec0-440d-9cc8-ffcffddb302d.html">property tax reductions</a>,” Carr said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Grizzly speed limit?</strong></p>



<p>Looking back on his summer managing the mayhem in 2021, Stoinski sees human nature as a major driver of behavior that can’t be overlooked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People coming from across the country to visit the parks, or to visit Wyoming, and they see a grizzly bear for the first time in their lives, they just can&#8217;t help but stop,” Stoinski said. “There&#8217;s got to be a balance between letting people enjoy the bears while they&#8217;re near the road without getting too close.”</p>



<p>One thing that authorities can control is the speed limit. For his part, Stoinski would like to see variable speed limits deployed when grizzlies are in the area and bear jams become unavoidable.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit.&#8221;</p><cite>Steve Stoinski, retired USFWS Special agent </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Wyoming has variable speed limits for blizzards along the interstate, he noted. Why not take the concept for a test drive along Togwotee?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit, you know when the bears are around the highway,” he said. “Slow traffic down just for people’s safety.”</p>



<p>Already, electronic signs posted along the highway tell people not to stop on the road to view bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://jhwildlife.org/">Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation</a> Executive Director Renee Seidler encourages wildlife enthusiasts to find safer spots to view bears.</p>



<p>“The biggest issue is the road, the traffic, the speed and very little capacity to manage the crowds,” Seidler said, compared to nearby wildlife viewing hot spots in Teton Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seidler also said the agencies might not have yet found the right mix of “carrot and stick.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a recurring problem that I would love to see fixed,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>LARAMIE—A March <a href="https://wyofile.com/appeals-court-backs-corner-crossers-in-wyoming-public-lands-case/">ruling</a> by a federal appeals court in a widely watched corner-crossing case determined that private landowners cannot bar access to public lands with fences, trespass actions or other methods.</p>



<p>Hunters, recreators and public lands advocates celebrated the ruling and its implications for the states within the 10th Circuit — Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Oklahoma and Kansas.</p>



<p>Thursday, however, Ryan Semerad, the attorney who represented the <a href="https://wyofile.com/corner-crossing/">four Missouri hunters in the </a>federal civil lawsuit, urged recreators to exercise caution and goodwill if attempting to corner cross — or step from one piece of public land to another where those two parcels meet at a common corner with two private parcels, in a checkboard pattern of ownership. Wyoming’s checkerboard spans more than 2 million acres.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are limitations to that decision,” Semerad said Thursday during a corner-crossing panel discussion in Laramie. “That doesn&#8217;t mean go jump on your side by side … and just have at it. It doesn&#8217;t mean you get to go on private property without permission, consent or something else. What it means is that you have reasonable access to step from one section to the next section, so long as you can be situated appropriately, you know where the monument marker is, you know where you&#8217;re going and you respect that.”</p>

(Wyoming Backcountry Hunters and Anglers)</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are also outstanding questions for landowners, said Wyoming Stock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna, another panelist. His group filed an amicus brief in the case in support of the landowner who sued the Missouri hunters for stepping over, but never touching, Elk Mountain Ranch property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s pretty clear that you cannot deny access to these checkerboard lands,” Magagna said. “Does that mean that you have to allow crossing at every corner? If I want to identify one of the four corners that I control as the access point, do I have the liberty to do that? Or if I want to designate a path through the middle of my private land in lieu of granting access across the corners?</p>



<p>“Those are many of the questions that still remain out there to be addressed,” Magagna said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As they talked, it became clear that interpretations of the ruling still vary widely. But both urged common sense and respectful communication —&nbsp;traditional tenets of Wyoming hunting etiquette regarding private landowners.</p>



<p>“We need to remember that it&#8217;s a culture of cooperation with these lands, and that&#8217;s how this is going to work moving forward,” Semerad said.</p>



<p>The panel was part of the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation Summit, a two-day event bringing together outdoor recreation business leaders, public lands agency officials, nonprofits and others to strengthen the burgeoning industry and enhance access to resources. The summit is one product of newly expanded state government support of the outdoor recreation —&nbsp;Wyoming’s Office of Outdoor Recreation helps put it on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Appropriately, the panel addressed a legal question that has captivated recreators in Wyoming and the nation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hunters, a wealthy landowner, trespass charges</strong> </h4>



<p>In 2020, hunters Brad Cape, John Slowensky and Phillip Yeomans corner crossed to hunt on Elk Mountain, then did so again with Zach Smith in 2021.</p>



<p>Carbon County ranch owner Fred Eshelman sued the four men in 2022 for passing through the airspace above his property on their way to hunt.</p>



<p>Eshelman sued to block them, and anyone else, from corner crossing to reach some 11,000 acres of federal and state land enmeshed in his 50-square-mile ranch, a coveted hunting ground known for its abundant wildlife.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="602" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?resize=780%2C602&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-112206" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?resize=1024%2C790&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?resize=300%2C232&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?resize=768%2C593&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?resize=400%2C309&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Corner-x-appeals-court-graphic-1024x790.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The appeals court used this graphic to depict corner crossing. (IU.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)</figcaption></figure>



<p>That set off a series of court challenges and appeals in a case that involved everything from the limits of private property rights to the extent of airspace and the legality of preventing the public from accessing public land.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With implications not only for the 2.4 million acres of “corner-locked” land in Wyoming, but also for 8.3 million acres across the West, the case gained national attention, particularly among hunters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It culminated in March with the appeals court decision. In a unanimous opinion, the three-judge panel sided against Eshelman, citing an act of Congress that preempts Wyoming trespass law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congress enacted the Unlawful Inclosures Act in 1885. “No one may completely prevent or obstruct another from peacefully entering or freely passing over or through public lands,” the act says, according to the appellate judges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The act, which explicitly prohibits “obstructing transit over public lands by force, threats, intimidation, or by any fencing or inclosing,” supersedes Wyoming trespass law, the judges ruled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that means in practical terms, Semerad said Thursday, is this: “You can now step from one section of public land to the next. In Wyoming, there is no state law, statute or regulation that can stop you; the federal law would preempt it.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Questions remain </strong></h4>



<p>Magagna believes the ruling is aimed explicitly at the checkerboard — not islands of public land surrounded by private land elsewhere, he said Thursday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Semerad disagreed. “The Unlawful Inclosures Act applies to all public lands,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderator Dan McCoy, director of the Jay Kemmerer WORTH Institute, asked if the Wyoming Legislature or the state could have a bearing on the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee will discuss corner crossing when it holds an interim meeting June 5-6 in Dubois.&nbsp;</p>

(Steven Brutger)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though the ruling clearly states the Unlawful Inclosures Act is supreme, Magagna said, “I think where there is opportunity, potentially for the Legislature should they choose to do so, is to better define the tools that are available and the limitations on the use of those tools.” He also brought up land exchanges by which more public land could become accessible without the necessity of corner crossing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what should recreators do if they come across a corner that’s fenced off, McCoy asked.</p>



<p>“If you come across a fenced corner, call me, call the U.S. Attorney’s office because that&#8217;s unlawful,” Semerad said. “That is straight up a violation of the Unlawful Inclosures Act.”</p>



<p>The March decision might not be the final word in the corner-crossing case. There is a chance it will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, Semerad said. The earliest the high court could see it is next winter, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, both men stressed a spirit of collaboration when it comes to public land users and private property owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Respect and cooperation is always going to take us much further than if we&#8217;re just going to be battling it out all the time,” Semerad said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real answer to all this, to me and I think to many people I represent,” Magagna added, “is the relationships we build in Wyoming with people, between private landowners and the recreation and outdoor community, particularly the sportsmen, hunters and fishermen. So I think that the key thing, for now at least, is to build those relationships.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“It’s going to be a big old-fashioned horse race,” Hunter Whitney said as he lounged in his makeshift camp Wednesday at the Teton County Fairgrounds, waiting for the opening of shed-antler hunting season.</p>



<p>Camp stoves, backpacks, folding chairs and even a cornhole set surrounded the Star Valley resident as he catnapped among picnic tables at his sidewalk quarters. A long-cold fried egg lay abandoned in a skillet, a pair of sturdy boots aired out on the concrete.</p>



<p>Through a lottery arranged by the Jackson Police Department, Whitney won a coveted spot close to the front of the &#8220;Shed Hunt Motorcade.&#8221; The hundreds of police-escorted pickups and horse trailers would snake through town to be turned loose on nearby public land at 6 a.m. Thursday. That’s the official Wyoming Game and Fish Department time when antler hunting starts and big game winter range opens in the western and southwestern parts of the state.</p>

<p>Male elk shed hundreds of antlers in the spring, dropping some of them on national forest land beyond the National Elk Refuge — home to some 7,000 elk each winter. The refuge itself is closed to antler gathering except for the local Boy Scout troop, which collects them for an annual auction.</p>



<p>Last year, bidders paid an average of more than $26 a pound. A skull and antlers from a winter-kill elk can bring thousands of dollars, depending on size and condition.</p>



<p>The lottery and motorcade replaced the mayhem of various helter-skelter mass starts that marked iterations of the antler rush in years past.</p>



<p>Mike Jackson, No. 265, drove up from Lyman for his first-ever hunt. He and his family arrived at a prescribed time to park in their place in line.</p>

<p>For a day and a night, the fairgrounds became a community of campers with a common goal. For $20 a head, they could corral their mounts in various nearby rodeo pens.</p>



<p>The Jacksons were going to a restaurant before cozying up in their horse trailer to sleep.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They planned to get up at 5 a.m., saddle their steeds, load them in the trailer and join the 5:45 a.m. procession to the city limits and open range beyond.</p>



<p>The lottery drew 513 applications, each costing $20, for a designated motorcade spot. By Wednesday afternoon, some 400 vehicles had lined up along Snow King Avenue in a queue that snaked into and around the fairgrounds.</p>





<p>Dubois resident Ty Finley drew No. 2. He was pleased. The No. 1 pickup ahead of him towed a horse trailer that carried only ATVs. Those aren’t allowed off dirt roads, so Finley was pretty sure he would be leading the charge.</p>



<p>After drawing his coveted spot, “I was trying to make sure none of my friends found out about it,” he joked. In fact, he showed up with many friends — Boedeckers, Hankinns, Cragoes, Hadleys and Eastburns — seemingly half the town of Dubois.</p>

<p>Wyoming’s Bureau of Land Management state director has been placed on administrative leave after a federal investigation found he violated ethics regulations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Andrew Archuleta accepted a gift of dinner and drinks, misused his assistant’s time when he asked her to make travel arrangements for his girlfriend and drove his girlfriend to and from Buffalo in a government vehicle — all in violation of the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ARCHULETA-BLM.pdf">according to a February investigation summary from the Office of Inspector General.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Archuleta was placed on leave in April, BLM Wyoming Senior Advisor Brad Purdy confirmed Wednesday. Kris Kirby has been named acting state director, Purdy said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Archuleta was selected to helm the state’s BLM office in January 2022. In the position, he has overseen the management of 17.5 million surface acres of public lands and more than 40 million acres of federal sub-surface mineral lands. He directed an office with more than 600 permanent staff and 150 seasonal employees who help manage everything from energy development and livestock grazing to campgrounds, multi-use trails, outdoor recreation spots and wild horses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He occupied the spot during a time of tumult and national attention. The 2023 release of the draft Rock Springs Field Office Resource Management Plan sparked furor and heated debate over how to manage some 3.6 million acres of public lands in southwestern Wyoming. <a href="https://wyofile.com/biden-administration-finalizes-rock-springs-plan-without-further-changes/">The plan</a> spurred <a href="https://wyofile.com/after-public-furor-task-force-offers-guidance-on-blms-plan-for-sw-wyoming/">state intervention</a>, drew thousands of comments and triggered fierce criticism of the federal government by elected officials and others.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Gifts, travel, rental cars</strong></h4>



<p>The Office of Inspector General investigated allegations that Archuleta may have violated the ethical conduct standards when he “accepted a gift of dinner and drinks at a Cheyenne, Wyoming, steakhouse from the owner of a commercial sign manufacturing company,” according to the investigation summary.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Investigators found that he was in violation in that matter, according to the summary. They also determined Archuleta misused his subordinate’s time when he asked his assistant to make air travel arrangements on the clock for his girlfriend to accompany him on official travel, the summary states.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“In addition, we determined that Archuleta misused a Government rental vehicle in violation of DOI policy when he allowed his girlfriend to drive the rental vehicle and that he violated the Federal Travel Regulation when he used the Government rental car for personal purposes,” the summary continues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, investigators found Archuleta violated policy when he drove his girlfriend to and from Buffalo in a government vehicle “because she was neither a Federal employee nor conducting official Government business there.”&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Background&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Archuleta’s career in federal service stretches back three decades, according to a BLM press release that announced his 2022 selection. His former assignments include BLM Colorado’s Northwest District manager and district manager for BLM’s California Desert District. He has also worked for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the U.S. Forest Service.</p>



<p>“His understanding of rural communities and the challenges they face coupled with the expertise he has developed will continue to benefit the BLM and the Wyoming communities and constituencies we serve,” former BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning said in the 2022 announcement.</p>



<p>Archuleta, a Colorado native, earned both a bachelor’s degree in wildlife biology and a master’s degree in wildlife toxicology from Colorado State University. He is an avid outdoorsman, according to the BLM.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Purdy could not comment on further action or future steps regarding Archuleta’s position.&nbsp;</p>



<p>WyoFile was unable to contact Archuleta on Wednesday for comment.</p>

<p>WEST YELLOWSTONE, MONTANA—Tchotchke shop owners are busy stocking shelves with Old Faithful shot glasses, stuffed teddy bears and Yellowstone hoodies. Motel managers are hiring their last employees as the summer tourism season begins with the opening of Yellowstone’s West Entrance today.</p>



<p>After park crews plowed a winter’s worth of snow from roads, visitors are now motoring to Old Faithful, Canyon and Norris, marking the unofficial start to the summer. This year, fewer of those tourists, ogling at “red dog” bison calves, delighting in a geyser’s eruption and soaking up spectacular mountain views, will likely be international travelers.</p>



<p>Overseas travel to the U.S. nosedived 11.6% in March, reflecting jitters over Trump administration tariffs, stock market turmoil and foreign bitterness toward the country’s altered relationship with the rest of the world.</p>



<p>Several data points reveal a sluggish start to the summer tourism season.</p>



<p>The International Trade Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Commerce, reported the 11.6% drop in overseas visitation in March. (The figure, compared to the same month last year, does not reflect travelers from Canada and Mexico.)</p>



<p>“U.S. Economy to Lose Billions as Foreign Tourists Stay Away,” Bloomberg headlined <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-set-lose-billions-100000258.html">an April 14 story</a>.</p>



<p>Mike Gierau, a state senator, restaurant owner and co-chairman of JH AIR, a nonprofit business consortium that coordinates service to Jackson Hole, sees the tide. “International travel is dropping like a stone based on all the stuff coming from Washington,” he said.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“It’s not going to be a record year.” </p><cite>Rick Howe</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Moreover, at the South Entrance to the world’s first national park, the Jackson Hole Chamber of Commerce reports a dip in the 60-day outlook for already booked hotel rooms compared to 2024.</p>



<p>Rick Howe, the chamber&#8217;s president, said June and July “are not as strong as we would expect — they’re not picking up as quickly as they [usually] do.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>That 60-day outlook, released March 31, shows about 54% of coming days falling shy of last year’s numbers based on bookings at 16 hotels.</p>



<p>“It’s not going to be a record year,” Howe said.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Not giving up hope</strong></h4>



<p>In 2024, travel spending in Wyoming amounted to $4.9 billion, according to the Wyoming Office of Tourism. Travel and tourism supported 33,610 jobs, generated $278 million in tax receipts and resulted in 8.8 million overnight visitors, the office said in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FmFaklZS88yxdgCeEnUwEoCuxT1QfvBs/view">a review of last year</a>.</p>



<p>Tourism, Gierau said, is the second-largest revenue-generating industry in the Equality State behind energy development. “In tourism, everything you do is taxed,” he said, “everything we buy, everything we sell.”</p>



<p>Despite the data dips, industry officials hope and believe in redemption. If overseas visitors aren’t coming to the U.S., Americans could forego foreign travel as well, spending their time vacationing closer to home instead.</p>



<p>“One door closes, another opens,” Gierau said.</p>



<p>Also, the outlook for visitors to Jackson Hole, while not yet documented by the chamber, is upbeat for August and September, Howe said. Overall, “we’re pretty much on par with last summer — for the moment,” he said.</p>

<p>At Yellowstone’s East Entrance near Cody, lodge owners have seen “a little bit of a drop,” in reservations, said Jennifer Thoma, the executive director of the Cody Country Chamber of Commerce. There’s now a glimmer of relief.</p>



<p>“It seems like reservation numbers are back up,” she said.</p>



<p>In addition to tariffs, market turmoil and foreign enmity, DOGE cuts to the National Park Service and U.S. Forest Service have rattled travelers. Those <a href="https://wyofile.com/are-you-a-federal-worker-in-wyoming-wyofile-wants-to-hear-from-you/">indiscriminate firings and resignations</a> have sparked worries that campgrounds won’t open and toilets won’t be cleaned.</p>



<p>Tourism industry leaders seek to assure potential customers that DOGE disorder won’t affect their vacations. Yellowstone National Park Lodges General Manager Mike Keller acknowledged in an email that Park Service “staffing uncertainty” has generated worries.</p>



<p>“We are here to assure you that our operations are unaffected and we are ready to welcome you to a memorable Yellowstone experience this spring and summer,” his email reads. “The park remains open, the views are as breathtaking as ever, the wildlife is flourishing, and the sense of wonder that Yellowstone National Park evokes is unchanging and eternal.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>COVID redux?</strong></h4>



<p>For Howe at the Jackson chamber, the season could mimic the surge in RV campers and regional travel that accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. “People are not worried services won’t be available,” he said.</p>



<p>“We are not hearing the concerns that we were two to three weeks ago,” Howe said. “Those calls are not happening anymore.”</p>





<p>He also asked innkeepers a month ago to report whether they’re getting calls from people cancelling reservations because of economic hardships. “The answer is ‘no,’” he said.</p>



<p>Reflecting information from airlines, Gierau predicted “a good summer,” but also one that’s “just different.”</p>



<p>There will be fewer bus tours filled with foreigners and, instead, more people “on the senior circuit,” he said.</p>



<p>The next Jackson chamber 60-day outlook through mid-June, compiled by consultants DestiMetrics, publishes April 20. A crash is “not a major concern at the moment,” Howe said.“It’s kind of a moving target,” Howe said of the summer forecast. “With all the things going on, things changing rapidly, it’s hard to know.”</p>

<p>When Jaelin Kauf zipped through moguls and jumps to win two world freestyle skiing titles this winter, she was far from the cowbells, gluhwein, chocolate and other slopeside paraphernalia that speckles historic European ski venues.</p>



<p>She skidded to a stop March 1 at the bottom of Kazakhstan’s <a href="https://shymbulak.com/">Shymbulak Mountain Resort</a>, a central Asian slope on the other side of the globe from her hometown of Alta, Wyoming. With two more races still on her international schedule, Kauf had just beaten Japan’s Rino Yanagimoto in the dual moguls event and secured the season’s crystal globe trophy for that discipline.</p>



<p>In besting Yanagimoto, she had also accumulated the most points for the season in both mogul events — the head-to-head duals and the single-skier competitions.</p>



<p>Her phone started buzzing.</p>



<p>“I was texting my parents … checking,” she said. “They said, ‘you also just secured the overall.’”</p>



<p>Kauf couldn’t believe it.</p>



<p>“Are you sure?” she texted back. “Are you positive? I don&#8217;t want to believe it or say anything if it&#8217;s not actually true.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“My mom taught us how to do 360s off a catwalk.”<br><br></p><cite>Jaelin Kauf</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>It was all true, but only half the season’s story. Within a couple of weeks, Kauf went on to Livigno, Italy, to win the freestyle single’s globe and then to fabled St. Moritz, Switzerland, to win the duals medal in the world Championships.</p>



<p>All those points, globes and medals might be as confusing to flatlanders as a mogul field is to an intermediate skier, but they shake out to simple truths.</p>



<p>Wyoming’s Jaelin Kauf, 28, dominates the freestyle moguls circuit. She won an unprecedented American crystal globe hat trick on the International Ski Federation tour this winter. She won the 2025 dual mogul world championship and is headed to next season’s Olympics in Cortina, Italy, where she hopes to add gold to her 2022 Beijing silver.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>360s at the ’Ghee</strong></h4>



<p>Born in Vail, Colorado, to parents who skied on the pro mogul circuit, Kauf and her family moved to Alta and Grand Targhee Resort when she was three. Moguls — German for “small hills” — didn’t suit her at first. But she was determined to follow her older brother Skyler through the obstacles.</p>



<p>Then came mother Patti.</p>



<p>“My mom taught us how to do 360s off a catwalk or [by] just hitting road jumps or things around the mountain,” she said.</p>



<p>Skiers have long tested one another by racing down smooth courses and between gates set tightly for slalom and farther apart for giant slalom and downhill. Moguls were mine fields where grooming machines and racers didn’t venture.</p>

<figure class="alignright size-full is-resized"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="720" height="479" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jaelin-as-a-kid.jpeg?resize=720%2C479&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-113002" style="width:400px;height:auto" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jaelin-as-a-kid.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jaelin-as-a-kid.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jaelin-as-a-kid.jpeg?resize=400%2C266&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Jaelin-as-a-kid.jpeg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Jaelin Kauf learned the bumps growing up at Grand Targhee Resort on the west slope of the Tetons. (Patti Kauf)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>That’s until the 1970s when Canadian <a href="https://skimuseum.ca/honoured-members/wayne-wong/">Wayne Wong</a> donned his white-rimmed mirror shades, got in the back seat and twisted his way through bumps in a new, expressive style — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfV6_Ezan58">hot-dogging</a>. Wong even incorporated a flip, the Wong-banger, into a bag of tricks that catapulted him onto posters found above many ski tuning benches across North America.</p>



<p>Today’s freestyle competition requires racing through manufactured snow moguls and over two kickers that enable skiers to perform aerial acrobatics. Judges rank competitors on time, style and form. In duals, skiers race side by side.</p>



<p>Kauf’s hometown hill, Grand Targhee, is blessed with snow and even moguls, but it’s not a mecca for budding aerialists. Kauf’s best simulation was on a trampoline. By the time she entered high school, the family had moved to Steamboat Springs, Colorado.</p>



<p>That town is home to storied Howelsen Hill, a rare natural ski-jumping venue. Building on that heritage, the town also created one of the few American ski water ramps where athletes can practice aerial maneuvers in summer above a safe landing.</p>



<p>With aerials under her belt, Kauf in 2016 earned the rookie of the year title on the World Cup tour. Since then, she’s bumped and jumped her way to glory.</p>



<p>She has 16 World Cup victories, 50 World Cup podiums, a World Championships gold medal, seven U.S. Championship titles, and an Olympic silver medal. Along with <a href="https://wyofile.com/breezy-johnson-becomes-wyomings-double-world-champ/">Breezy Johnson</a>, this year’s world champion downhill and team combined alpine champion who calls Jackson Hole Mountain Resort home, Kauf has again elevated Wyoming to the top of the world podium.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>On to Cortina</strong></h3>



<p>At the culmination of Kauf’s season in St. Moritz, her family — mother Patti, stepfather Squeak Melehes, father Scott and stepmother Muffy Mead-Ferro — joined a smallish band of spectators and fans. Freestyle hasn’t captured the Europeans as completely as downhill and slalom, events in which stars bask in as much limelight as NFL quarterbacks do in the U.S. Nevertheless, “the locals or people free skiing would definitely stop and check out the event and see what&#8217;s going on,” Kauf said.</p>

(Logan Swney/ U.S. Ski Team)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Regardless of the immediate audience, Kauf has been on the largest sports platform, including competing at two Olympics. In Beijing, even though COVID clouded her experience, the Olympic aura shone through.</p>



<p>“I got to walk out in opening ceremonies and perform on that stage,” she said. “It was still the Olympics.”</p>



<p>Kauf visited China again this year when Beidahu hosted a moguls event and where she found welcoming hosts. “They are very excited to have us there,” she said. “Everyone was really friendly and nice.”</p>



<p>She’s now focused on Cortina, which last hosted the winter Olympics in 1956. The coming games offer a double chance — individual and the duals medals.</p>





<p>“It&#8217;s not just focusing on that singles run,” she said. “You have to think about duals strategy as well.”</p>



<p>She’s eyeing “a very clean, zipper line right down the middle … hoping to bring in a bit higher degree of difficulty into my jumps.”</p>



<p>Wyoming will be there with her. Kauf wears &#8220;Deliver the Love,&#8221; on the back of her helmet, “Grand Targhee” on the front. In her gear bag, she said, she’s even got “a few brown and gold things.”</p>

<p>April eases Grand Teton and Yellowstone national parks into the hustle of summer, coaxing cyclists to dust off their steeds for car-free exploration of otherwise heavily trafficked scenic routes.</p>



<p>In Wyoming’s two federal reserves, workers plow a winter’s worth of snow from highways, then open the roads exclusively for bicyclists and pedestrians. And in Yellowstone, for a bison or 10.</p>



<p>&#8220;It’s a rite of spring,” said Jackson resident Anna Davis, who rode 28 miles along the base of the Teton Mountains with a small band of friends Sunday. “To be able to bike in that setting, under those peaks with no cars, there’s not a lot of things like it.”</p>





<p>The internal-combustion-engine-free window is brief, however. Yellowstone opened the 49 miles between West Yellowstone and Mammoth to cycling last weekend and will allow motorized vehicles April 18. In Grand Teton, the Teton Park Road will not open to cars until May.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not only cyclists who enjoy the open roads. On sunny weekends, thousands flock to Grand Teton’s Taggart Lake Trailhead to stroll with the family, rollerblade or skateboard. The first mile is a gallimaufry spiced with every color and brand of outdoor togs.</p>



<p>“I just love the sort of carnival atmosphere,” Davis said of that popular starting point. “Everyone’s so excited to be there. It’s hectic, but everybody’s being nice.”</p>

<p>In a battle over taxes and access to Wyoming’s wide open spaces, U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis voted against a measure that would have blocked the government from selling public land to help fund the federal budget.</p>



<p>Wyoming’s two Republican senators voted Friday evening against a budget amendment brought by Colorado’s Democratic Sen. John Hickenlooper that would “prevent[…] the use of proceeds from public land sales to reduce the Federal deficit.”</p>



<p>Democrats and conservationists have decried the GOP’s openness to sell federal land to fund the budget, saying such a divestiture of beloved public assets would be used to offset tax cuts for the wealthy.</p>



<p>“Republicans are saying that they need to sell off your public lands to solve the housing crisis,” said Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat who co-sponsored the failed <a href="https://www.heinrich.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/public_lands_amendment_text.pdf">budget amendment</a>. “But we already have laws that allow for targeted land transfers for things like housing,” he said in an Instagram post.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“I think it’s a signal to Wyoming [that Barrasso and Lummis] are OK with selling off public lands for the benefit of America’s wealthiest people.” <br></p><cite>Jordan Schreiber</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Instead, Heinrich said, selling public land under budget reconciliation “means their goal isn&#8217;t housing — it&#8217;s selling your public land to pay for a tax cut for people like Elon Musk.”</p>



<p>Wyoming public land users should take note of their senators’ votes, said Jordan Schreiber, an Equality State native and director of government relations with The Wilderness Society.</p>



<p>“I think it’s a signal to Wyoming [that Barrasso and Lummis] are OK with selling off public lands for the benefit of America’s wealthiest people,” she said.</p>



<p>The Wyoming Outdoor Council also criticized the Wyoming senators, saying their “disappointing” votes “leave our public lands vulnerable in this budget reconciliation process.”</p>



<p>Their vote “completely ignores the vast benefits that our public lands in Wyoming provide for rural communities and our quality of life,” Alec Underwood, Outdoor Council program director, said in a statement.</p>



<p>Neither Lummis nor Barrasso responded to a request for comment Monday.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>False hype?</strong></h4>



<p>Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah called the anti-sales budget amendment “false hype” that would only restrict use of land-sales funds. “It doesn’t stop land sales,” he said, promoting the effort.</p>



<p>Opposition to federal land sales “restricts our ability to do anything, everything, develop, plan, build houses, which we desperately need, even to fund our schools, our search-and-rescue, our police services,” Lee said. “This is disgraceful,” he said of the amendment just before it failed Friday.</p>



<p>While Republicans say sales will resolve affordable housing problems in expensive real estate markets near national parks and other desirable locations, Democrats and conservationists see the move as more insidious.</p>



<p>That’s because Republicans have put federal land sales on <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000194-74a8-d40a-ab9e-7fbc70940000">a menu of items</a> Congress could use to pay for the budget, according to a document obtained by Politico. The menu catalogues as a “savings” any action that “increases sale of federal land.” The value of such sales to the budget is “to be determined,” the document states.</p>

<p>“This vote [on the amendment] is a wake-up call and part of a concerning, larger campaign being waged against public lands at every level of government,” said Wilderness Society President Tracy Stone-Manning, who served as director of the Bureau of Land Management under President Joe Biden. In a statement, she ticked off other anti-conservation actions by the Trump administration, “including mass firings of land managers and executive orders that demand more drilling and mining.</p>



<p>“It appears,” she said, “their ultimate goal is to destroy our conservation heritage, totally contrary to what Americans actually value.”</p>



<p>That conservation heritage underpins Wyoming’s outdoor recreation and tourism economies, both of which are centered around the Yellowstone ecosystem. Tourism is Wyoming’s second-largest industry and generated $4.8 billion in 2023, employing 33,000 people, according to a University of Wyoming <a href="https://www.uwyo.edu/worth/_files/worth-annual-report-2024.pdf#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20WORTH%20Initiative?%20Tourism%20is,sector%20in%20Wyoming%2C%20employing%20over%2033%2C000%20people.">study</a>.</p>



<p>Wyoming residents and lawmakers have supported the industry and public lands in a number of ways. This year, the Legislature <a href="https://wyofile.com/senate-kills-resolution-demanding-takeover-of-federal-land-in-wyoming/">defeated a resolution</a> calling on Congress to begin the process of turning over all federal land in the state, except Yellowstone, to Wyoming.</p>





<p>In 2024, Wyoming lawmakers also authorized the sale of the square-mile <a href="https://wyofile.com/after-decades-of-political-maneuvering-grand-teton-buys-wyomings-kelly-parcel-today/">Kelly Parcel</a> of state school trust land in Grand Teton National Park for conservation, not for development or affordable housing.</p>



<p>The state itself, through Gov. Mark Gordon and Attorney General Bridget Hill, also refused to back the grossest claims in a <a href="https://wyofile.com/federal-opposition-to-utah-land-grab-suit-cites-former-wyoming-ag/">fast-track Utah petition</a> to the Supreme Court that sought to give the Beehive State 18.5 million of federal land. Wyoming’s official filing tepidly supported Utah but stopped short of demanding federal property.</p>



<p>The Supreme Court <a href="https://wyofile.com/supreme-court-rejects-utah-wyoming-claims-on-federal-public-lands/">rejected Utah’s effort</a>, dismissing strong <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-backs-utahs-quest-to-seize-blm-land-may-want-other-fed-property/">Utah backers</a> like Wyoming’s lone U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman and Wyoming Freedom Caucus members. Critics of Western states’ efforts to take over ownership of federal property say the states could never afford to manage the land and would end up selling it to private interests, destroying the public access to public lands enjoyed by all Americans.</p>



<p>Colorado’s Sen. Hickenlooper, who sponsored the anti-sale budget amendment that died Friday, said his measure would have “prevent[ed] this reckless fire sale of our campgrounds, our forests, our national treasures.”</p>

<p>The Wyoming Supreme Court has dismissed a Teton County water-protection group’s challenge of a state-issued sewage permit for a glamping hotel in a polluted watershed.</p>



<p>The court ruled Tuesday that the nonprofit Protect our Water Jackson Hole doesn’t have standing — sufficient stake or investment in the issue — to challenge a Wyoming Department of Environmental Quality permit issued to the glamping owners. Although Protect Our Water is not the object of the DEQ decision, it claims to be affected by the development’s impacts, thereby allowing it to sue, its lawyers maintained.</p>



<p>The Supreme Court said some of POWJH’s arguments were vague — and that it hadn’t met other requirements — as the justices sided with a lower court that had dismissed the complaint.</p>



<p>“We are unable to conclude that POWJH has shown a tangible interest in the water quality in Fish Creek that is distinguishable from any other member of the general public,” Chief Justice Kate Fox wrote for the court.</p>



<p>The interests of POWJH and its supporters are real, the group’s executive director Phil Powers said. “We live in a beautiful single-source aquifer on the Snake River,” he said, “it’s fragile and we need to protect it.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“It is difficult to tell exactly what ‘stakeholder involvement’ might mean or how that might improve water quality.” </p><cite>Kate Fox</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Protect Our Water claimed that DEQ had turned over its responsibility to issue permits to Teton County and therefore had no authority to approve sewerage for glamping operator Basecamp. The Utah business operates the Tammah fabric-covered dome hotel on state school trust land in the Fish Creek drainage west of the Snake River near the ski resort at Teton Village.</p>



<p>“Somehow Tammah managed to get a permit directly from the state,” Powers said. “That just skipped over the expectations we have in the county — we think that’s inappropriate.”</p>



<p>DEQ lists Fish Creek as a Class I waterway, meaning it should receive the highest level of protection. In 2020, the agency concluded the creek was impaired for the purposes of recreation — people fish there and float down the creek in innertubes — due to E. coli. The harmful bacteria can cause illness and death and is associated with sewage.</p>



<p><a href="https://tetoncountywy.gov/DocumentCenter/View/28907/03223-Letter-to-WYDEQ-on-Fish-Creek">Drastic development</a> threatens the watershed with other pollutants, Teton County officials say. The water-quality group has fought pollution in the area and seeks to help Teton County abate pollution.</p>



<p>“You can’t just run roughshod over that shallow aquifer,” Powers said, “and expect all of us to maintain clean drinking water and great recreation water as well.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>To demonstrate its bona fides and interests, POWJH said it has spent approximately $164,000 for water quality monitoring in Fish Creek, another $88,000 for stakeholder involvement and some $250,000 for the Teton County Water Quality Master Plan. Protect Our Water “briefly alleges that its ‘supporters’ use Fish Creek ‘for a variety of recreational, scenic, and aesthetic purposes,’” the court said in summarizing the complaint.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>That’s not enough</strong></h4>



<p>Without challenging POWJH’s assertions regarding its expenditures and supporters’ use of Fish Creek, the court rejected the group’s challenge. It based its decision on the “standing” issue and said the organization’s arguments were vague.</p>



<p>POWJH alleged “its water quality initiatives were intended to ‘improve’ the water quality in Fish Creek and … the activity authorized by the permit will harm that water quality,” the court wrote. But the group “has not described any improvements that have actually resulted from its efforts.</p>





<p>“It is difficult to tell exactly what ‘stakeholder involvement’ might mean or how that might improve water quality,” the decision reads. “Likewise, POWJH has done nothing to elaborate on ‘the Water Quality Master Plan process’ except to say that it ‘is underway in Teton County and has important implications for the Fish Creek watershed.’</p>



<p>“Just what these implications are is not apparent from POWJH’s submissions,” Chief Justice Fox wrote.</p>



<p>“Finally, though POWJH claims that its supporters use Fish Creek for certain recreational purposes, it does not identify them, allege that those supporters are formally affiliated with POWJH, or make any attempt to claim standing through any of its members or affiliates,” the opinion reads.</p>



<p>The group doesn’t explain how pollution will hinder its efforts to monitor water quality, involve stakeholders and work on a water quality master plan with Teton County, the decision said. Those were key elements in POWJH’s arguments.</p>



<p>Protect Our Water “has not sufficiently described its three listed activities so that even a favorable reading of the complaint could support a conclusion that those particular activities would become more expensive due to a reduction in water quality,” Fox wrote.</p>



<p>The Basecamp/Tammah glamping hotel has drawn significant opposition in Teton County ever since 2020, when the Legislature targeted state land in wealthy and expensive Jackson-area for revenue-generating development. Opponents object to a lax oversight and permitting, changing development sideboards and other problems at the development along a scenic road.</p>



<p>Basecamp and Tammah have repeatedly said they have abided by all conditions required in their lease of the state property.</p>
