<p>Wyoming school districts and community interests have clashed for several years over gender identity policies and parental rights.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignleft is-style-border has-white-color has-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Opinion</h3>
</div></div>



<p>That’s not likely to end soon, despite <a href="https://wyofile.com/judge-rock-springs-school-didnt-violate-parental-rights-in-transgender-pronoun-case/">a federal judge’s well-reasoned decision</a> last week to dismiss a lawsuit filed by parents against a Sweetwater County school district that respects student requests to use their preferred name and pronouns in school. Under the policy teachers do not discuss the issue with parents unless they ask.</p>



<p>Lawmakers in Wyoming have passed several controversial gender-related bills, including a ban on transgender girls competing in sports against cisgender girls, and prohibiting gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. It’s part of a concerted far-right crusade to limit the rights of transgender youth.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Sweetwater County case is the important legal question of whether school districts must notify parents about changes in their child’s preferred name and pronouns. The “well-being” of children is typically cited, no matter what action is advocated.</p>



<p>In 2023, Rock Springs parents Ashley and Sean Willey filed a civil rights lawsuit against Sweetwater County School District No. 1, alleging it violated their rights during the 2021-22 school year by withholding information about their child’s request that the high school’s teachers and staff use a preferred male name and pronouns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The parents accused the district of keeping that news from them by continuing to use the high school student’s gender assigned at birth in their presence, while using the teen’s preferred name and pronouns in school.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl, dismissing the lawsuit and ruling in the school district’s favor, explained why the parents’ rights weren’t violated.</p>



<p>“A respectful and nondiscriminatory school environment is a legitimate state interest,” the judge wrote. “Referring to students by preferred names and even declining to proactively inform parents to respect a student’s choice are both rationally related to that interest. Thus, the district policies and staff members’ actions pass constitutional muster.” </p>



<p>It’s a profound conclusion that has been voiced in other states, including a 2022 Wisconsin case that kept a school district&#8217;s policy intact. The Wisconsin ACLU said in an amicus brief that outing children to their families could be dangerous because <a href="https://badgerherald.com/news/madison/2022/07/19/wisconsin-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-mmsd-transgender-student-policy/">one-third of transgender children are rejected by their families</a> after coming out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Human Rights Campaign, 22 states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring schools to provide non-discriminatory environments in which students can safely express their gender identities. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/state-maps">Wyoming is not one of them</a>.</p>



<p>Skavdahl dismissed all of the parents’ claims, including a separate allegation that Ashley Willey, a special education teacher at another Sweetwater County school, said she didn&#8217;t follow the district&#8217;s policy to use students’ preferred names and pronouns but was never disciplined or retaliated against for her decision.</p>



<p>Still, she maintained the policy itself violated her rights to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a parent and as a teacher. Willey claimed the district’s failure to proactively inform her about her child’s gender identity changes interfered with her religious beliefs because it kept her from information she needed to counsel her child.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a heck of a stretch, and Skavdahl noted why it&#8217;s out of bounds.</p>



<p>“A person’s constitutional right to freely exercise their own religious beliefs does not require that the state also exercise those same religious beliefs,” the judge wrote. “To conclude that the district’s failure to act in accordance with plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”</p>



<p>The Willeys asserted parents have a right to make decisions about their children’s well-being, including their physical and mental health. The judge agreed, but added there is a “laundry list of circumstances that could affect a child’s ‘well-being’ even in the slightest that would require constant, detailed information sharing from the school, with constitutional consequences.”</p>



<p>The judge noted the school district “merely respected” the student&#8217;s voluntary choices, didn&#8217;t withhold information from the parents, and when the Willeys sought it, the information was provided. Skavdahl added the district didn’t require the child to go by a preferred name or pronouns, or “discourage students from discussing their gender identities with their parents.”</p>



<p>The Willeys contended teachers facilitated the student’s gender transition socially, and invalidated the parents’ right to make medical decisions for their teen. But Skavdahl wrote there was no evidence the school provided any type of medical transition or social transitioning, “and defendants were not involved in changing the student’s clothing or hairstyle.”</p>



<p>I don’t think parents should blame the school district or teachers for not voluntarily providing answers to every question they have about their child, including gender identity. Educators are frequently reminded by parents that while they are paid to instruct their child during school hours, parents are primarily responsible for their well-being, medical needs, instilling religious values, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I find it improbable that a parent who may question a change in their child’s appearance or behavior can’t pick up some clues from observing their interactions with others, including family members and friends. Skavdahl is correct: parents are entitled to information about their children from educators, who must honestly answer these questions when asked.</p>



<p>But if teachers and staff are required to identify every change in a student’s “well-being” and notify each parent, not many lessons will be taught.</p>



<p>I have other concerns about how courts will handle future school gender identity cases. The Willeys’ lawsuit took two years to be dismissed. The <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/04/29/judge-sides-with-rock-springs-schools-tosses-parents-gender-transition-lawsuit/">parents, as is their right, will appeal</a>, according to their attorney.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think it’s fair to say that across the country, the extreme right’s anti-trans campaign has picked up speed, particularly under President Donald Trump’s new administration, and public support is unfortunately waning for school district policies protecting students’ gender identities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How this will play out in the courts is anybody’s guess. Last May the U.S. Supreme Court declined to <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/supreme-court-turns-down-case-challenging-school-districts-transgender-policies/2024/05">take up a case about a Maryland school district’s policies</a> to support transgender students and when parents may challenge them. But the high court declined it because the parents who sued did not have standing, not because of the case&#8217;s merits.</p>



<p>Several conservative groups and 17 red states filed a friend of the court brief, arguing “parents must have the right to ask for the court’s help in securing the fundamental right to know what schools are doing with their kids.” What will the conservative court do when a similar case isn’t dismissed for technical reasons?</p>



<p>In another Maryland case the U.S. Supreme Court heard last month, justices’ questions seemed to overwhelmingly favor allowing parents to opt out their children from <a href="https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/maryland-parents-await-supreme-court-religious-liberty">language arts lessons that included LGBTQ books.</a></p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/10/01/pronouns-schools-supreme-court-00118832">Politico article took a stab at predicting</a> how the high court will weigh the interests of transgender or gender-nonconforming children and “their public school protectors versus parents’ interests in making decisions regarding the health care, education and upbringing of their children.”</p>



<p>“It is easy to see where the trajectory is going,” Politico concluded. “Conservative ‘values’ will probably win.”Does a thoughtful ruling like Skavdahl’s stand a chance to prevail at a higher level? It deserves to and it’s a victory worth celebrating in Wyoming, but I too have little faith that in the end Trump’s conservative Supreme Court majority will allow that to happen.</p>

<p>When Lander resident Tina Clifford sent a public records request in August to Fremont County seeking more detailed election information than what was already publicly available, she wasn’t sure to whom she should send it, what it would cost or how long it would take.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignleft is-style-border has-white-color has-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Opinion</h3>
</div></div>



<p>Ms. Clifford&#8217;s grandson and my son are part of the same homeschool group and we started talking about her experience requesting records during one of our weekly school days. That conversation prompted this column, because&nbsp; the information about public records requests is insufficient on Fremont County&#8217;s website. When Ms. Clifford sent her request to County Clerk Julie Freese she didn’t hear back for over three weeks and emailed her again seeking an update. County Attorney Nathan Maxon returned her email and told her that two employees had thus far spent 18 hours on her request. That time would not cost Ms. Clifford, he wrote, but the remaining work would be billed to her at $70 per hour with an estimated cost of $560. He requested that she let him know if she wanted the remaining work done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clifford’s experience is just one of many examples of the arbitrary response times, lack of transparency and sparse instructions on how or where to send a public records request in Wyoming. It’s also why the Public Records Act should be overhauled during next year’s legislative session.</p>



<p>The current <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/LSOResearch/2019/19PR002.pdf">Wyoming Public Records Act</a> requires the government to respond promptly showing receipt of the request and to release requested records no later than 30 days after sending the receipt unless good cause exists to extend the time frame. But a court ruling found that government entities may charge a “reasonable fee” for reproducing records — leaving open the possibility that different people could be charged different amounts and that counties within the state could set vastly different fees for the same type of request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why Rep. Pepper Ottman, R-Riverton, would like to see consistency across the state with specifics on how to submit requests, what can be released and fees that are consistent across the state. She’d also like the law to clearly state who is responsible for handling requests under the Wyoming Public Records Act. Ottman is hopeful reform will be debated in next year’s shortened budget legislative session.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some of Mountain States Policy Center’s ideas to strengthen the Public Records Act:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Don’t distinguish between requesters. Bad actors exist everywhere and there should be equal treatment for everyone.</li>



<li>Have a set fee schedule detailed in statute for everyone.</li>



<li>Process large record requests in installments, and cancel requests if the fee is not paid for the first installment.</li>



<li>Allow requestors to narrow or refine requests if the time estimate is too long and/or fees are too large.</li>



<li>Use the federal definition from the National Freedom of Information Coalition research for burdensome requests. The state’s Public Records Ombudsman could then be empowered to hear concerns from a government entity if that definition has been met.</li>



<li>Provide Wyoming’s Public Records Ombudsman with more authority to assist and mediate disputes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some requests can’t be fulfilled by statute, including an individual’s income tax forms, school and medical records and government personnel files, among others. And some requests require a large amount of time to complete and may not be able to be finished within a 30-day time frame. But both government employees and those requesting information should have a clear understanding of their obligations, fees, timing and how the process is supposed to work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having easily understood regulations is no guarantee that the government will comply, as evidenced by the thousands of lawsuits against the federal government for not fulfilling FOIA requests. But here in Wyoming, we can do better. Passing an enhanced Public Records Act would build trust in state and local government. In addition, state and local government agencies would do themselves a big favor by proactively posting as much information online as possible. Upfront transparency would mitigate the need for public records requests.</p>



<p>Strengthening the Wyoming Public Records Act should not be a partisan issue. Every resident deserves a government accountable to the people it serves. Legislators should prioritize it in 2026.</p>

<p>In its 2024 budget session, the Wyoming Legislature added a footnote to the budget for the University of Wyoming stating “no funds from this appropriation shall be expended on the office of diversity, equity and inclusion at the University of Wyoming or on any diversity, equity and inclusion program, activity or function.” As a result, the UW closed that office while reassigning some of its functions to other units. Then, UW&#8217;s Faculty Senate this spring agreed to <a href="https://www.wyomingpublicmedia.org/news/2024-02-28/senate-votes-to-defund-university-of-wyoming-diversity-office-and-gender-studies-courses-but-the-fights-not-over">terminate the undergraduate academic degrees in gender and women’s studies</a>. Another bill defunding DEI more broadly was adopted by the legislature in 2025, but was vetoed by Gov. Mark Gordon.</p>

<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Opinion</h3>
</div></div>



<p>I am continually baffled at why the Legislature, and others in Wyoming government, are so vehemently opposed to diversity, equity and inclusion. In my world, each one of those things is a value to celebrate, not an evil to eradicate.</p>



<p>Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder said at the time of the cut to UW’s budget that DEI has become a form of reverse discrimination. She claimed that DEI programs create “preferential treatment of one race, one gender over another, and [that] one race [is] inherently racist over another.” But that is a logical fallacy; specifically, a false dichotomy. It results from zero-sum thinking.</p>



<p>Zero-sum games are situations where for every winner, there is a loser. Think of a typical sale transaction: for every dollar the buyer pays, the seller gains a dollar. The net sum is zero. On the flip side, for every item the seller sells, he loses that item, but the buyer gains the item. Still a net zero.</p>



<p>But human interactions are seldom zero-sum games. They are most often plus-sum games, where both participants gain something from the interaction. Working together, respecting and learning from each other, leaves both participants better off. A plus-sum game. A win-win.</p>



<p>Since DEI practices and attitudes promote respect and learning between different groups, it is a plus-sum game. If a favored, dominant group reaches out to understand and respect a disfavored or oppressed group, that does not weaken the dominant group. The false dichotomy is that social prestige and opportunity are not a win-lose situation. One does not have to choose between which group has opportunities. Sharing opportunities can lift up both groups to heights neither could attain separately.</p>



<p>President Donald Trump has many flaws, but perhaps his biggest flaw is that he seems incapable of anything other than zero-sum thinking. Everything he does is transactional, and he must always “win.” He sees immigrants as taking “our” jobs. Foreign governments are stealing “our” money by having trade surpluses (never mind that private commercial transactions, not foreign governments, create trade imbalances). Law firms that represent his opponents are taking power away from him, so they must be punished. Courts that restrain his illegal actions also deprive him of power, so they must be attacked. All of this he does because of his irrational need to “win” the zero-sum games he perceives.</p>



<p>The Wyoming Freedom Caucus, possibly taking their cue from Trump, is likewise stuck in zero-sum thinking. Its ongoing efforts to defund DEI programs appear to be an attempt to institutionalize the power of favored groups over disfavored groups, apparently in the belief that lifting up the disfavored group somehow diminishes the favored group.</p>



<p>But diversity, equity and inclusion are not zero-sum games. When we all work together — when we respect each other, share our talents with each other, treat each other with the dignity we deserve — we are all better off. Every one of us has a gift to make this world a better place. Let’s share those gifts freely with each other.</p>

<p>Amazingly, I’ve found common ground with Freedom Caucus legislators Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, and Steve Johnson, R-Cheyenne. They recently wrote in Cheyenne’s paper about the fallacy that one must be born in Wyoming to want to help the state. They correctly stated, “If the only qualification for good policy is a birth certificate stamped in Wyoming, we’re in trouble.” Too bad they didn’t stop there and omit claiming the Freedom Caucus, infamous for recent blunders like unconstitutionally gutting public education and encouraging guns in grade schools, aspires to “uphold the Constitution.”&nbsp;</p>

</div></div>



<p>Still, they’re right that Wyoming birth qualifies no one as an authority on Wyoming. Like so much else, you don’t choose your birthplace. Same with skin color, sexual identity and family of origin. Everyone’s entitled to relish heritage, but not to borrow glory.</p>



<p>Not that I don’t try. The good representatives continued, “Ideas should rise or fall on their own merit — not on where someone’s great-grandfather ran cattle.” As it happens, mine ran his in Laramie County, which then reached to Montana. My forebears were, wait for it, immigrants, having struck out twice further east. Like many others, they came here seeking a better life. They relied upon the kindness of a Native American family who looked after my 12-year-old grandfather for the winter while my great-grandfather went back to Iowa to bring out more Yoders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To the extent that this story might inform my own ideas about the value of immigrants today, wonderful. But I deserve no points for the postholes they dug for the Swan Company or the homestead they bought out and improved on Bear Creek.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Becket Hinckley, born and raised in Basin, ran successfully for a Cheyenne seat in the 2000s, he was vilified as a Californian — he’d attended Stanford. Such parochialism inspired my letter to the editor, with which Pendergraft and Johnson should logically agree.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, protesters are showing up all around Wyoming to resist the excesses and abuses of the Trump administration. Harriet Hageman has received her fair share of complaints about it. What has been her reaction?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When her responses were jeered in Laramie on March 19, she called the protesters “organized.” Her apologists claimed they were paid and brought into the state to flood the event. I attended her March 20 town hall in Wheatland, which was packed with what looked and sounded to me like Wyoming people. I heard, “I’m a lifelong Republican, but I’m worried about __________” repeatedly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hageman thereafter switched to virtual town halls but is now doing very controlled in-person events. You must preregister, giving your full name, address, and email address, and agree to receive her newsletter. It’s not clear if out-of-staters or even out-of-county Wyomingites will be allowed in.</p>



<p>I bet no one except police is being paid to show up at the rallies I attend. I recognize lots of people — from church, volunteer work and around town. They’re hardly out-of-staters “being brought in” or “paid.” At one, I asked a mother and daughter where they were from and they said Saddle Ridge, north of Cheyenne. Most people driving past the Capitol honking in support display the ugly new Wyoming plates.</p>



<p>But so what if some protesters aren’t from Wyoming? Does it make their concerns about the state of the country any less compelling if they call Nebraska or Colorado home? I write to senators from other states whenever the spirit moves me. To his staff’s credit, Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., answers, even though I live here. His recent reply was quicker and lots better than what I get from Barrasso. His milquetoast assertions about the “waste, fraud and abuse” co-president Musk has “found” fall flat and ignore the fallout Barrasso’s constituents are suffering under Musk’s chainsaw.</p>



<p>Call me a foolish optimist, but I think it’s great for America that people are exercising First Amendment rights and demanding that our leaders know just how dimly we view the improper rejigging of our government. It’s good for the body politic to remind itself where the real power in this country is — vested in us. If that means that we, the people, have to walk around carrying signs, so be it. I just wish I’d needlepointed one I saw on TV: “I’m so angry I stitched this so I could legally stab something 4000 times.”</p>

<p>I bumped into my old friend Nicky Chiffon at the Clown’s Den south of Cheyenne the other night. We hadn’t seen each other in decades, so we had some catchin’ up to do. Back in the day, we stole horses and smuggled contraband together, so we had a bond.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignleft is-style-border has-white-color has-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Opinion</h3>
</div></div>



<p>He is a strange cat, so I’ll have to explain Nicky to you. His ancestors were Mayan priests and priestesses, and they passed down to Nicky the secret rituals of human sacrifice as practiced in the Yucatan. When we first met, he was the reigning welterweight knife-fighting champion of the Caribbean.</p>



<p>Always a rabid Broncos fan, Nicky was heartbroken when John Elway retired, so he cloistered himself in a Maoist transgender nunnery in the Red Desert. He taught switchblade tactics to the sisters and dabbled in blackbone voodoo. He recently wore out his welcome and was 86ed from the convent for being “ideologically unsound,” hence our reunion.</p>



<p>We found a sticky little table in a dark corner of the strip joint and discussed the deconstructionist politics of 21st-century America as we sipped our Everclear smoothies. Nicky, an astute student of collapsed civilizations, waxed prophetic about the U. S. of A.</p>



<p>“You had it all, amigo. You built it up ‘til you were on top of the pyramid. And now you’re tearing it all down just because some weird rich guy is pissed off at everything. The feathered serpent god is not pleased, compadre.” Nicky sucked on his straw with hollowed cheeks, and added, “I see dark days ahead, if you don’t wake up pronto. Dark days.”</p>



<p>I looked nonplussed, so he continued. “Think about it, cabrón. You fought a revolution so common people could have power, and now you’re giving that power to wealthy corporations. Caramba! How stupid is that?”</p>



<p>That made me take a big slug from my own glass of Everclear.</p>



<p>“It took you 250 years to create all these magnificent democratic institutions,” he said, “and now you’re getting rid of them because they annoy the upper class. See what I mean?”</p>



<p>I asked Nicky for specific examples.</p>



<p>“Okay,” he said, rising to the task. “The U.S. is supposed to be a country that welcomes new ideas, right? Americans always say they support freedom of thought and expression.” I must have nodded in agreement, because he went on. “Then why are you allowing the government to ban books and accuse libraries of sedition, just because powerful oligarchs don’t like what’s written down? That don’t make no sense.”</p>



<p>I ordered another round as Nicky warmed to the subject.</p>



<p>“And you created the judicial branch so that you’d be governed by laws, not a king. But here you are, arresting judges just because they don’t toe a political line. What would your Founding Fathers think about that horseshit?”</p>



<p>Nicky’s brow sweated and veins throbbed at his temple when he said, “And you stand around like peasants when your president threatens to jail anyone who protests against him. It’s almost like you’re willing to pay extra for British tea these days.”</p>



<p>At that point, the jukebox began playing Dylan’s “The Times They Are A-Changin’” and the stripper slowly twirled around her pole.</p>



<p>“Listen, Nicky,” I said, “these are changing times. Don’t be so hard on us.”</p>



<p>“Times change, sí. But some things shouldn’t.” He regarded me with those obsidian Mayan eyes. “If you throw away everything that made you great, you discard your foundation. Then your civilization is built on quicksand or goat manure. If something needs fixed, then fix it. But the first rule of intelligent tinkering is to save all the parts.”</p>



<p>Nicky’s straw made a slurping sound as he sucked up the last of his hooch. He banged his fist on the table for more and said, “My grandpa taught me that rule. I bet yours did, too. If my ancestors, the Mayans, or even the Romans, or the Sumerians, had followed that rule, they’d still be around today. Don’t throw away the good stuff!”</p>



<p>We tried to drink the Clown’s Den dry that night, and in our younger days, we could have. But we have mellowed with age, Nicky Chiffon and I, so we stumbled out the door and parted with our secret handshake. Nicky limped off to his next adventure, while I stood gazing up into the dark American night.</p>

<p>Safety was the reason Wyoming Congresswoman Harriet Hageman said she put the brakes on her town hall road show a month ago <a href="https://hageman.house.gov/media/press-releases/hageman-plans-future-events-be-held-virtually-because-democrat-threats-0">in favor of virtual events.</a></p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignleft is-style-border has-white-color has-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Opinion</h3>
</div></div>



<p>But when she returned in person in Buffalo last Thursday, the truth was the only thing that seemed to be in danger. Hageman, an attorney, was called out by members of the audience for <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/04/24/cheers-challenges-and-a-few-boos-as-hageman-resumes-in-person-town-halls/">telling an outrageous whopper</a> about a deportation case, then doubling down on her false claims.</p>



<p>The incident demonstrated there’s nothing Hageman won’t do to defend President Donald Trump in his war against the federal judiciary and the rule of law. It also showed the political peril we&#8217;re in, when truth is continually distorted by the MAGA movement Hageman embraces.</p>



<p>Because of new rules that limited who could attend, Buffalo’s Bomber Mountain Civic Center was a much friendlier environment than Hageman experienced March 19 in Laramie, when many in the crowd of about 500 <a href="https://wyofile.com/crowd-jeers-hageman-at-tense-laramie-town-hall-she-calls-them-hysterical/">booed, cursed and heckled her.</a></p>



<p>Two hundred people with reservations to the Buffalo town hall signed up through Hageman’s office, according to Cowboy State Daily. <a href="https://wyofile.com/hageman-quietly-resumes-in-person-town-halls/">No one could directly ask a question live</a>, but queries were handwritten and placed in a box.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The most contentious moment came after Hageman pulled out a question about whether she would pressure the Trump administration to do what the U.S. Supreme Court said it must: return a wrongfully deported Maryland man to the U.S.</p>



<p>The high court unanimously ruled Abrego Garcia should get the hearing he was denied before federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers sent him to a notorious prison in El Salvador.</p>



<p>Many in the crowd erupted in protest when Hageman bluntly said no. They asked why there was no due process in Garcia’s case.</p>



<p>The administration initially admitted to a lower court that Garcia’s deportation was due to an “administrative error.” An immigration judge ruled in October 2019 that Garcia, who had entered the country illegally as a teen, had <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/kilmar-abrego-garcia-deported-el-salvador-trump-immigration-what-know-rcna201708">“a well-founded fear” of persecution</a> by a gang in El Salvador that had been extorting his family for years. The judge granted Garcia protection from being deported.</p>



<p>“First of all, [Garcia] was given due process,” Hageman said, which was met by shouts of “no.” She continued: “He went in front of two different immigration judges [who] ruled that he was a member of [the gang] MS-13. That’s due process.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>But she inaccurately stated what happened. Garcia was detained by police after they saw him and three other men allegedly “loitering” outside a Home Depot store. Because of his clothing, tattoos and a confidential informant’s claim he was a MS-13 member, Garcia was taken into custody in 2019 by ICE.</p>



<p>The judges Hageman referred to both denied Garcia bail, because of the gang allegations, which remain unproven. He’s never been charged with a crime, despite <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/trump-doubles-down-on-denying-kilmar-abrego-garcia-due-process-with-new-claims/ar-AA1DCIHz?ocid=BingNewsSerp">Trump’s sensational claims</a> he’s a convicted human trafficker and wife-beater. After a third judge ordered that Garcia not be deported, ICE did not appeal and he returned to his wife, a U.S. citizen, and their three children.</p>



<p>Hageman jumped headfirst into the rabbit hole dug by Trump and U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who contend the Supreme Court didn’t order Garcia’s return.</p>



<p>“In fact, they reversed the district court and said [it] used the word ‘facilitate’ [his return],” Hageman argued. “I have never heard of a writ of facilitation, but oh well.”</p>



<p>In fact, the high court used the word when it unanimously found the lower court’s order “properly requires the Government to ‘facilitate’ Abrego Garcia&#8217;s release from custody in El Salvador and to ensure that his case is handled as it would have been had he not been improperly sent to El Salvador.”</p>



<p>After trying to make her phony case that Garcia did receive due process, a&nbsp; term the lawyer of course understands, Hageman’s next words were truly stunning.</p>



<p>“And as far as due process, I’m not sure what you are talking about or what you mean by due process,” she said, with a straight face. This wasn&#8217;t a case of legal amnesia, but an example of what earned Hageman such&nbsp;</p>



<p>a hostile response in Laramie by taunting and dismissing her critics.</p>



<p>“Are you kidding me?” a woman yelled over the noise of the crowd.</p>



<p>Hageman stumbled. “Yes, no I’m not,” she said.</p>



<p>“You’re a lawyer!” the woman said.</p>



<p>“Yes, I am. Due process is notice and an opportunity to be heard, and he was given notice and an opportunity to be heard,” Hageman said.</p>



<p>No. After being given a temporary visa and work permit, Garcia spent five years in a construction apprenticeship program before being pulled over by ICE officers in Baltimore last month. He was told his immigration status had changed, and was then arrested and transferred to jails in three states before being flown with other deportees to CECOT prison in El Salvador. Like many inmates he was held in brutal conditions, never given a hearing, and believed he&#8217;d be held indefinitely.</p>



<p>Trump wants to keep it that way, and judging by Hageman’s responses in Buffalo, she’s perfectly OK with that. To her it’s justice.</p>



<p>But <a href="https://legalclarity.org/what-is-the-simple-definition-of-due-process-of-law/">due process of law</a> is much more than Hageman’s simplistic definition at her town hall. It’s a fundamental principle in the legal system that ensures fairness and justice. It serves as a safeguard against arbitrary denial of life, liberty or property by requiring adherence to established legal procedures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This concept is crucial for upholding individual rights and maintaining public confidence in the judicial process. Thanks in large part to Hageman and U.S. Sens. John Barrasso and Cynthia Lummis, who support Trump&#8217;s continued defiance of the federal judiciary, confidence in the legal process is very low in Wyoming these days.</p>



<p>More than 100 Wyoming jurists warned the delegation <a href="https://wyofile.com/condemn-attacks-on-judiciary-wyoming-lawyers-and-judges-urge-delegation/">in a March 26 letter</a> that Trump and his allies’ threats could erode the country’s rule of law.</p>



<p>These distinguished members of the Wyoming Bar — including a former governor and three ex-Wyoming Supreme Court justices — were insultingly <a href="https://wyofile.com/barrasso-lummis-hageman-deride-concerned-wyoming-jurists-as-biased-liberal/">called “biased, misguided” and “liberal”</a> by Barrasso, Lummis and Hageman in a press release. The delegation said federal judges are the problem, not the president.</p>



<p>But as more news about Garcia’s shameful treatment comes out, it shines a bright light on Hageman’s cruel defense of Trump&#8217;s refusal to bring him home. The U.S. is paying El Salvador $6 million to keep more than 230 alleged gang members, including Garcia, who was recently transferred to a lower security prison because of his high profile.</p>



<p>It’s a nasty game Trump is playing in cahoots with El Salvador’s dictator, Nayib Bukele, over Garcia’s fate. Using a ridiculously narrow definition of “facilitate,” AG Bondi said, “We would facilitate [his release], meaning provide a plane.”</p>



<p>But Bukele vows to hold Garcia in prison forever, and Trump says he&#8217;s a terrorist who will never again set foot on American soil.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>On Friday, however, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/kilmar-abrego-garcia-plan-reversal/682594/">The Atlantic broke the story</a> that U.S. officials were actively trying to bring Garcia home before their plans were blocked by Trump, who suddenly saw Garcia’s plight as a major political win in his fight with the courts over his deportation agenda.</p>



<p>The State Department puzzled over the sketchy evidence tying Garcia to a gang. Officials worried about his safety in prison where he could be targeted for attack. All of these concerns are valid.</p>



<p>Hageman didn&#8217;t need to throw Garcia, who has endured suffering for weeks and had his rights violated at Trump&#8217;s hands, under the bus. But it was red meat for her base, which can never get enough stories about how this president is supposedly leading the fight against crime.</p>



<p>But the truth matters, and so does the rule of law. How can we protect both when officials like Hageman turn a blind eye to justice?</p>



<p>Keep asking her hard questions at town halls and then vote her out of office.</p>

<p>Faith communities are good at charity, but often fail to explore the root causes of the problems they see. But addressing social ills requires a deeper examination, writes guest columnist Rev. Dee Lundberg.</p>

<p>Ronald Rolheiser tells the story in his 1999 book, “The Holy Longing,” of the residents of a town by a river who were consistently pulling drowning people out of the water. They did not know where the drowning people came from, but always cared for them, until one day it dawned on them to go upriver and see why they were drowning.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignleft is-style-border has-white-color has-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">

</div></div>



<p>Faith communities are often like this. We are very good with charity but fail to go upstream and confront <em>why</em> people are drowning. The needs are overwhelming, yet we are afraid to stir the waters lest we appear &#8220;political.” However, if we want to stop the suffering, we must engage in the social justice work needed to stop the drowning. For it was Jesus himself who unabashedly confronted those very systems of oppression. Are we afraid to follow him all the way? In the end, have we helped or have we enabled or even encouraged more bodies to be thrown into the river? Is it our goal to just help these poor drowning people, so we can feel good about ourselves, or are we ready to stop the drowning?</p>



<p>Justice isn’t political, it’s the gospel. It can be seen as divisive, but it is what we are called to do and be as people of faith. You know the line from Mica: “God has told you, O mortal, what is good; and what does God require of you but to do justice, and to love kindness, and to walk humbly with your God?” This is not an either/or. As people of faith, we are called to care for those in need, but we must also work for the kind of justice that will free them from their suffering so that the drowning will cease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year’s legislation in Cheyenne was woefully short of any justice, nor kindness for that matter. For instance, having successfully passed through two Senate committees, Sen. Cheri Steinmetz’s Senate File 124, “<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/SF0124">Illegal immigration-identify, report, detain and deport</a>,” was designed to root out immigrants living in Wyoming who had entered the country illegally. However, it was also plagued with language essentially permitting racial profiling. It had no regard for the children who might come home from school and find no parents and sought to criminalize Wyomingites who knowingly associate with undocumented immigrants. The bill also made it a felony punishable with prison time and hefty fines to knowingly transport or shelter a person who came into the country illegally.</p>



<p>House Bill 72, “<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/HB0072">Protecting privacy in public spaces act</a>, and Senate File 62, “<a href="https://wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2025/SF0062">Sex-designated facilities and public schools</a>,” while seeking to protect Women’s privacy, opened the transgender community to not only their right to privacy, but their safety. Laws like these seek only to stigmatize, degrade and oppress.</p>



<p>Justice shouldn’t be a partisan issue, yet law after law was put through with no regard for the countless lives they would harm. We, as people of faith, have been called time and again to seek justice, yet too many sit on the sidelines, shaking our heads while saying, “isn’t it awful?” Well, the session is over, but the work is not.</p>



<p>We have sat by too long watching while, tragically, many a “Christian” has hijacked the faith in favor of hate, intolerance and downright heartless cruelty. Does your God say “judge” (I’m pretty sure we were explicitly told not to judge) or reach out? Is it not our call to show love to the scorned, the ridiculed and the outcast?</p>



<p>You may have reservations about populations such as the transgender community. I do not, but even if I did, that’s not my call. My call is to care for them like any other neighbor. Your call is to treat them like any other neighbor. You may have reservations when it comes to immigration. Fine, continue your discernment, please. But they, too, are our neighbors.</p>



<p>Being Christian is not a spectator sport. We must risk going against the rapids to get to the source of the problem. You don’t have to support a party or person. That would be political. But we are all called to be on the side of justice.</p>

<p>I have often heard the story of the young boy flying a kite with his dad. Together they watched as their kite flew higher and higher. Eventually, the kite ran out of string, and the boy encouraged his father to let the string go so the kite could continue to rise. The dad explained that if he let go, the kite would fall.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignleft is-style-border has-white-color has-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Opinion</h3>
</div></div>



<p>The boy persisted, and eventually the dad agreed to let the string go. Immediately, the kite began to fly erratically and soon fell to the ground. The dad then explained to his son that although the string appeared to keep the kite from going higher, it was the string that kept the kite anchored and in the air.</p>



<p>Like the string that allows the kite to fly by providing an anchor and direction, so too does the rule of law keep society aloft.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I have seen instances when groups have tried to evade the rule of law to fly without restrictions. One notable example is the recent elections of officers for the Park County GOP.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On March 13, the Park County GOP came together for the election of its executive committee. This was done even though members of the executive committee knew there hadn’t been proper statutory notice of 10 days under W.S. 22-4-105. Before the vote started, a point of order was brought stating since there had not been proper notice, the election could not take place. A motion to suspend the bylaws requiring notice was made, but the motion was ruled out of order because state statute requires the notice, and statutes cannot be suspended. The election was rescheduled for March 31.</p>



<p>On March 31, the party reconvened —&nbsp;this time with proper statutory notice —&nbsp;to elect officers. While adopting voting rules, a motion was made to follow the state statute, which prohibits individuals from voting if they are not precinct committee people. The statutes regarding voting in these elections have been interpreted by the Wyoming Supreme Court to specifically restrict unelected executive committee members from voting. However, members of the executive committee presented a decision by the Wyoming GOP Dispute Resolution Committee claiming that statutes cannot control political parties. A motion was made to exclude the unauthorized people from voting because the party could not suspend state statute (much like the ruling made on March 13), but the motion was killed by the executive committee without a vote.</p>



<p>Why does this matter?</p>



<p>In Wyoming, political parties are specifically recognized by statute. As such, these bodies have certain privileges and rules that other social groups do not have. Two prime examples of the privileges of political parties are the ability to nominate candidates to fill vacant elected offices, like a county assessor, superintendent of public education, state treasurer or U.S. senator, and the use of public ballots to select their precinct representatives. To balance these privileges, political parties are required to follow basic statutory requirements.</p>



<p>Sadly, our political parties appear to fight against statutory control, arguing that they are merely a social club like the local Elks Lodge. At the same time, political parties are uninterested in relinquishing the same statutory powers that set them apart from groups like the Elks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if political parties are in fact no different from other local social clubs, it would be surprising if statutes were not amended to remove the constraints AND privileges political parties currently have. Followed to its logical end, removing political parties from our statutes would prohibit them from selecting nominees when filling vacant elected offices, resulting in a different process to fill vacancies like special elections. Primary elections would likely become more open like California’s “jungle primaries”, and parties would not be allowed to use public ballots for selecting their precinct representatives.</p>



<p>Perhaps some aim to remove parties from politics — an idea that George Washington likely would have supported. However, for those who do not want to see the systematic dismantling of political parties in Wyoming, I suggest we make one thing a priority: follow the law!</p>



<p>Just as a kite cannot have its string cut and refuse to obey the laws of physics, society cannot function to its fullest potential without laws. As for political parties, we cannot become so accustomed to our lofty privileges that we are willing to cut the statutory strings that attach us to society and not expect any consequences.</p>

<p>I have nothing against political protests. They are a great American tradition, enshrined in the First Amendment.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignleft is-style-border has-white-color has-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Opinion</h3>
</div></div>



<p>Filling the streets with like-minded folks, shouting slogans and carrying signs is great political theater. It draws a crowd and creates headlines in a brief news cycle. It encourages community, and signals the virtue of one ideology or another. But it doesn’t move the needle.</p>



<p>While a political protest might provide some emotional catharsis, and let off some steam, it won’t change things. It emphasizes symbolism over substance.</p>



<p>Think about it for a moment. All the folks that you see protesting on sidewalks in front of the capitol in Cheyenne, or in parks around the nation, are there for one reason only — they got outvoted in the last election. They are protesting because Trump won, or the Wyoming Freedom Caucus won, and those election victories have put a burr under their collective saddle.</p>



<p>I think protesters have lost sight of the fact that elections are not won by counting the number of people in the street, but by counting votes. Some 10,000 people rallying and toting signs won’t change a single vote in the last election. Protesters don’t realize that their real job is to win the next election by using the ballot to seize the reins of political power.</p>



<p>If they can do the grunt work of democracy, and win the next election, then they’ll instead force their political opponents to march around carrying signs and whining about losing political power. That sounds pretty satisfying to me.</p>



<p>Let’s look at some numbers.</p>



<p>In the last election, despite claims of a record voter turnout, roughly 40% of voting-eligible Wyomingites didn’t even bother to register. That represents around 150,000 votes that were never cast, a number large enough to swing any election in the Cowboy State. The same ratio holds for the national election as well, and is roughly consistent across gender and racial demographics.</p>



<p>We personally know these people who don’t participate in our elections. They are our family, friends, neighbors, the guy on the next barstool and the woman in the checkout line at the grocery store. They share our “blessings of liberty,” but do nothing to help secure it. To put it harshly, they are the dead weight of democracy.</p>



<p>And there are enough of them to truly change things.</p>



<p>I would argue that convincing these folks to register and vote is much more important than standing around with a protest sign, and screaming outrage into the wind. And that, friends and neighbors, is the only thing that will truly move the needle.</p>



<p>We will get better results by putting down our signs and getting our hands dirty by dialing phones and knocking on doors to reach these non-voters. We might ask ourselves, if I protest with one hand, and organize with the other, which hand will get the best results?</p>



<p>So I challenge all the “Hands Off” or “No Kings” protesters to spend 10 hours recruiting new voters for every hour they spend protesting. The work will be harder and more frustrating than attending a rally, but it’s the right tool for the job.</p>



<p>Don’t rely on anyone else to do this task, it’s up to us as citizens. The political parties won’t do it. The government won’t do it. It must be done citizen to citizen, neighbor to neighbor. It’s simply too important a chore to leave to anyone else.</p>



<p>Based on my personal experience, you’ll encounter a lot of excuses from the unregistered when you try to convince them to carry their weight. You’ll hear stuff like, “There’s too much dark money in politics,” or “The Freedom Caucus is making it too hard to vote,” or “The Russians manipulate our elections,” or “My voice won’t matter anyway.”</p>



<p>Horseshit! That is nothing more than a weak cop-out. Citizens should be prepared to crawl on their bellies over broken whiskey bottles to exercise the right to vote.</p>



<p>We enjoy the right to self-government through voting because 56 patriots signed the Declaration of Independence, providing us that opportunity. The last sentence before these 56 signatures reads, “And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes and our sacred Honor.”</p>



<p>Compared to our Founders’ commitment of their lives, fortunes and honor, shirking one’s responsibility to vote seems to be a piss-ant move, to me. And protesting just because your side gets out-voted is simply choosing the wrong tool for the job.</p>

<p>Republicans have targeted Medicaid funding for decades and it appears the party’s leaders, axes anxiously in hand, finally have it on the chopping block.</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignleft is-style-border has-white-color has-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">

</div></div>



<p>But the GOP doesn’t have to make huge cuts to a program that provides health insurance to 79 million low-income Americans. Even in a state as red as Wyoming, there should be pushback from voters, especially once people realize how much it will hurt access to health care for people of all ages and the risks it poses to rural hospitals and the economy.</p>



<p>U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman, R-Wyoming, certainly doesn’t want her constituents to know how close Congress is to cutting Medicaid. In her March 2 <a href="https://hageman.house.gov/sites/evo-subsites/hageman.house.gov/files/evo-media-document/the-wyoming-round-up-march-2%2C-2025.pdf">“Wyoming Round-up” email</a>, Hageman wrote such claims are “simply untrue” because a budget resolution she supported is just “a roadmap for future budget considerations and steps.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The resolution would extend provisions in President Donald Trump’s signature 2017 tax cuts for the wealthy that are due to expire. The $880 billion in cuts over the next decade that Hageman and all but one House Republican voted for can only come from programs the House Energy and Commerce Committee has jurisdiction over.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The math is conclusive: Major cuts to Medicaid are the only way to meet the House’s budget resolution requirements,” according to the <a href="https://www.kff.org/quick-take/the-math-is-conclusive-major-medicaid-cuts-are-the-only-way-to-meet-house-budget-resolution-requirements/">Kaiser Family Foundation</a>, a nonpartisan health policy research organization.</p>



<p>However, there are many paths the House and Senate can take as they try to reach an agreement on ways to cut Medicaid so Trump can have what he’s called his “big beautiful bill” with tax cuts for the rich. Wyoming GOP lawmakers who fought Medicaid expansion tooth and nail over the past dozen years — and turned down about $1.4 billion in federal funds in the process — need to look at how much of Medicaid&#8217;s cost will be dumped into the state’s lap by their own party.</p>



<p>Wyoming and the federal government now split the cost of providing Medicaid for nearly 64,000 residents, 35% of whom are&nbsp; children. About one-third of Wyoming births are paid by Medicaid, and the program pays for more than 70% of nursing home stays.</p>



<p>The Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, a progressive think tank, says Wyoming is one of 10 states that would face a massive cost shift if Congress removed the current “floor” on the federal match rate of 50%. But even if the rate was reduced to 40% rather than being eliminated, Wyoming would see a cost shift of $58 million this year, a 13% increase in state Medicaid costs.</p>



<p>“<a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/fact-sheet-republicans-in-congress-considering-harsh-medicaid-cuts-that-would-shift#pick_state=1&amp;state=Wyoming">Faced with increased cuts of this magnitude</a>,” the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities warns, “Wyoming could cut people from Medicaid to reduce enrollment, roll back benefits considered optional under Medicaid — such as home- and community-based services for seniors and people with disabilities — or shrink payment rates to health care providers.”</p>



<p>It’s not difficult to see Wyoming lawmakers making those choices, especially when the state is still losing mineral severance tax revenue and needs to spend more on education after losing a lawsuit for failing to properly fund public schools. But it won’t be popular, or easy to explain, when legislators go back home and get an earful from voters.</p>



<p>The vast majority of non-elderly adults enrolled in Medicaid either work or would likely qualify for work requirement exemptions due to having a disability, caring for family members, or attending school. But the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities says some Republicans are pushing to cut Medicaid by taking away coverage from people who do not meet a work requirement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Wyoming, according to the organization, 13,000 people would be at risk of losing coverage under one version of this proposal.</p>



<p>Another idea to reduce Medicaid expenses is for the federal government to set a fixed per-person spending limit instead of covering a percentage of actual patient costs. This would shift financial risks to the states while saving an estimated $900 billion over 10 years.</p>



<p>In Wyoming, capping Medicaid costs could result in pregnant women, children, seniors and disabled people losing their benefits or coverage. Because of Wyoming’s aging population, the state would quickly exceed the funding cap.</p>



<p>The feds could also switch to a block grant approach, giving states fixed lump sums and leaving them responsible for covering any shortfalls.</p>



<p><a href="https://stateline.org/2025/03/12/the-most-likely-medicaid-cuts-would-hit-rural-areas-the-hardest/">Many rural hospitals are struggling</a>, and nearly 200 have closed or significantly scaled back their services in the past 20 years. Rural hospitals have significantly lower operating margins than others and rely disproportionately on payments from Medicaid to remain in business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Wyoming, Medicaid cuts could hit rural hospitals with a double whammy, thanks to the uncertainty about how the state’s <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-hospital-districts-face-painful-funding-drop-with-property-tax-cut/?utm_source=WyoFile&amp;utm_campaign=f16d79b7a5-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2025_03_21_09_14_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-645a0a8947-">new 25% property tax cut</a> will impact the state’s 15 hospital districts that rely on such revenue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyoming has <a href="https://wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Rural_Hospitals_at_Risk_of_Closing.pdf">eight hospitals at risk of closing</a>, according to a recent Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform report. Every one of Wyoming’s 19 “Critical Access Hospitals” — small, rural hospitals with 25 or fewer beds located at least 35 miles from another hospital — <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-hospital-districts-face-painful-funding-drop-with-property-tax-cut/">operated at a loss in 2023</a>. Reducing tax revenues while simultaneously cutting Medicaid reimbursement rates will just increase the chances that rural Wyoming hospitals may close.</p>



<p>If there’s a silver lining, it’s that Medicaid is still a very popular program. A new survey by the University of Maryland found that Republican voters across the country, including in states like Wyoming that haven’t expanded Medicaid, widely support <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/republicans-want-to-expand-medicaid-new-poll-shows/ar-AA1DbPdY?ocid=BingNewsSerp">keeping or increasing federal spending</a> on the program.</p>



<p>So, why is Congress about to spend the next several months locked in a bitter partisan battle over Medicaid cuts? Part of it is the untested notion that the GOP is so committed to preserving Trump’s $4.5 trillion tax overhaul from his first term — known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — that it’s a done deal.</p>



<p>It’s not. Consider this: The U.S. Treasury’s Office of Tax Analysis estimates that the top 0.1% of earners would get <a href="https://apnews.com/article/tax-cuts-jobs-act-trump-treasury-agenda-f4031196e0d69d0a1630e3b06b6d3cd7">a tax cut of $314,000</a> under a full extension of the individual and estate tax provisions. The total cost of those tax cuts would amount to $4.2 trillion between 2026 and 2035.</p>



<p>Even gullible Americans who believe the rich will spend all of their tax savings to create jobs — instead of stock investments or stuffing it in offshore bank accounts — might think twice about giving the wealthy such huge tax breaks at the expense of vulnerable Medicaid recipients.</p>



<p>What happens when Americans realize that an $880 billion cut to Medicaid means their aging family members won’t be eligible for nursing home care?</p>



<p>The Economic Policy Institute says cutting Medicaid to pay for low taxes on the rich is a terrible trade. The institute notes Medicaid cuts that deprive children of access to health coverage <a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/cutting-medicaid-for-low-taxes-on-the-rich-is-terrible-for-american-families/">could actually increase the federal budget</a> in the long term because these children will not only be less healthy, they’ll grow up to earn less in wages, pay less in taxes and be more likely to receive other public benefits.</p>



<p>The Republicans’ margins in both the House and Senate are razor-thin. Last week, a group of 12 House Republicans sent a letter to House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-Louisiana, that stated, “We cannot and will not support a final reconciliation bill that includes any reduction in Medicaid coverage for vulnerable populations.”</p>



<p>It would only take peeling off a few GOP members in either chamber to change the dynamic of this entire Medicaid conversation. Once the tone shifts and public pressure builds to preserve Medicaid, maybe those tax breaks for the fat cats will stop being seen as a <em>fait accompli, </em>and their backers will be on the hot seat.</p>
