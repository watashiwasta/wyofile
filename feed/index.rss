Economist sees ‘disaster.’"></a></p>
<p>Gov. Mark Gordon said he sees &#8220;opportunity&#8221; for Wyoming in President Donald Trump&#8217;s tariff wars. At a press conference last week, he echoed the Wyoming congressional delegation&#8217;s praise for Trump&#8217;s economic policies as a tool to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. and level the nation&#8217;s trade imbalance with much of the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Trump tariffs have kind of shuffled the deck, in a way, and I think it&#8217;s a great opportunity for Wyoming to be able to pick up the game,&#8221; Gordon told reporters while highlighting his April <a href="https://wyofile.com/governor-trade-mission-to-japan-taiwan-could-increase-wyoming-fossil-fuel-exports/">trade mission to Japan and Taiwan</a>. &#8220;Taiwan very much understood that they can buy more [U.S.] energy and that will help their situation in the trade deficit.&#8221;</p>



<p>But southwest Wyoming, the world&#8217;s largest exporter of natural soda ash, along with agricultural producers, businesses reliant on tourism and natural resource extractive industries across the state — as well as ordinary Equality State consumers of almost anything — have cause for concern, according to one Wyoming economist.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s just no good way to spin the Trump administration&#8217;s economic policies in the short term,&#8221; University of Wyoming Associate Professor of Economics Rob Godby told WyoFile. &#8220;They&#8217;ve been disastrous, and they&#8217;re going to be disastrous.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

(Dustin Bleizeffer/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>The global oil market dominates much of the world&#8217;s economy and plays an outsized role in the nation&#8217;s economic pulse, especially Wyoming&#8217;s, Godby noted. So far, the market&#8217;s reaction is pointing to economic decline. That&#8217;s bad for Wyoming&#8217;s economy across the board, he said, and portends lower revenues to the state&#8217;s coffers.</p>



<p>Godby also serves on the state&#8217;s Consensus Revenue Estimating Group, which consists of the state&#8217;s top bean-counters tasked with estimating revenues to fund state and local governments. While tourism and agriculture play vital roles in the state&#8217;s revenue picture, Godby and his fellow CREG members closely monitor coal, oil and natural gas.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In addition to providing more than $2.4 billion in state revenues in 2023, the oil and natural gas industry supported nearly 59,000 direct and indirect jobs in the state, according to the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. But <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/business/energy-environment/exxon-chevron-earnings.html">U.S. oil prices have declined since Jan. 20</a>, when Trump began his second term in the White House, slipping by about 20% to around $56 per barrel over the weekend.</p>



<p>&#8220;I would say that the biggest effect on our revenues is really the indirect effect that will be caused by world oil prices, which is really driving down [Wyoming] oil revenues, especially in the last month and a half,&#8221; Godby said. &#8220;We&#8217;re not quite seeing it yet in terms of reported numbers, but we know it&#8217;s going to hit us because these prices are well below what we expected.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The CREG group is on the front lines of measuring Wyoming&#8217;s vulnerability in international trade and the overall U.S. economy, according to Gordon&#8217;s office. Gordon&#8217;s Communications Director Michael Pearlman told WyoFile, &#8220;We&#8217;re monitoring the tariff situation closely, which is constantly changing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Meantime, there are more acute concerns for Wyoming regarding Trump&#8217;s tariffs and potential retaliatory responses among U.S. trade partners, Godby said.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Trona and soda ash</strong></h4>



<p>Trona mined in Wyoming is processed into “natural” soda ash — a key component in the production of glass, baking soda and myriad other products. Wyoming’s trona and soda ash industry employs more than 2,000 workers, compared to about 4,100 direct jobs in Wyoming coal mining, according to the Wyoming Mining Association.</p>



<p>By far, soda ash is the state&#8217;s biggest foreign export commodity in terms of sales. Of Wyoming&#8217;s $2 billion in total exports in 2024, soda ash accounted for about $1.3 billion, according to Godby. China, Trump&#8217;s primary target in his tariff wars, typically accounts for about 10% of those soda ash purchases.</p>

<p>If the industry were to lose that 10%, it would be a significant blow, Godby said. What&#8217;s worse is the possibility that tariff wars might give a price advantage to synthetic soda ash, which Wyoming does not produce, and put a drag on exports to other nations.</p>



<p>&#8220;That could be a really significant impact on our [soda ash] exports,&#8221; he said, adding that it might even dampen plans for major expansions of trona mining and soda ash refining operations in the region.</p>



<p>WE Soda’s <a href="https://projectwest.com/">Project West</a>, a multi-billion dollar trona solution-mine expansion project now under construction near Granger, will create 2,000 temporary construction jobs, more than 400 permanent jobs and boost annual production by 3 million metric tons, according to the company. Pacific Soda&#8217;s proposed Dry Creek Trona Mine Project south of Green River, which has also crossed several <a href="https://eplanning.blm.gov/eplanning-ui/project/2016395/510">regulatory approval milestones</a>, would bring in another 2,000 construction jobs and create about 300 full-time jobs, according to the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This vital development [the Dry Creek Trona Mine] will create hundreds of good-paying jobs for hardworking Wyoming families while strengthening our domestic supply chain for essential minerals that keep costs lower at the store for everyday Americans,&#8221; Sen. Cynthia Lummis said in a prepared statement last week.</p>

<p>While the state&#8217;s trona and soda ash producers have been very &#8220;bullish&#8221; regarding exports in recent years, global dynamics for the commodities could change drastically if Trump&#8217;s trade wars escalate, according to Godby. Though the industry is not among the top three major influencers regarding the state&#8217;s overall revenue picture, &#8220;it does affect southwest Wyoming,&#8221; he said.</p>



<p>Though the industry may struggle in terms of past expectations to increase exports, Gordon said he hopes Trump&#8217;s policies might actually result in bringing glass manufacturing, which relies on soda ash, back to the U.S. and for the first time in Wyoming.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a long shot, but we&#8217;re really talking about bringing in glass manufacturers,&#8221; Gordon said, noting that he and his team visited with <a href="https://www.corning.com/careers/tw/en/careers/Locations/Taiwan.html">glass manufacturer Corning</a> while in Taiwan. &#8220;We talked about the possibility of being able to locate manufacturing here — a longtime dream of people in Wyoming. It may be a little bit more of an opportunity now with the backdrop of those tariffs.&#8221;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Oh, Canada, and China</strong></h4>



<p>Wyoming&#8217;s other vulnerability in international tariff wars is its reliance on Canada, the state&#8217;s largest international trading partner. The nation to the north accounts for about 20% of the state&#8217;s exports and 55% of imports, according to Godby. That translates into significant exposure for multiple goods, including robust trade of agricultural, manufacturing and heavy machinery components that both nations rely on in their natural resource extractive industries.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p> &#8220;If you really wanted to sandbag the U.S. economy, you couldn&#8217;t have done much of a better job.&#8221;</p><cite>Rob Godby, University of Wyoming</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>&#8220;That clearly is going to have supply chain effects in terms of impacts on consumers, or impacts on what we produce, given the products that we bring in from Canada,&#8221; Godby said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If [Trump] gets tough with Canada, they&#8217;ll get tough back,&#8221; he added, noting the recent election of Prime Minister Mark Carney, who <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/28/americas/canada-election-results-carney-poilievre-intl-hnk">promises to rebuke Trump&#8217;s policies</a>. &#8220;Even though they know it hurts, they&#8217;re willing to do that, and Wyoming would be a victim of that trade war.&#8221;</p>



<p>Combined, Canada and China account for nearly 65% of Wyoming&#8217;s imports, according to Godby. &#8220;Clearly, Wyoming could be impacted much more than the nation as a whole, if we get into a kind of a trade dispute with those two countries.&#8221;</p>



<p>Still, based on his recent <a href="https://wyofile.com/governor-trade-mission-to-japan-taiwan-could-increase-wyoming-fossil-fuel-exports/">trade mission to Japan and Taiwan</a>, Gordon said he believes the tariff and trade policy negotiations serve as motivation for those markets — as well as others — to balance their trade deficits with the United States. Though he heard concerns about Trump&#8217;s tariffs and retaliatory trade policies, he also heard assurances that Japan and Taiwan are interested in balancing their trade with the U.S. Ways to do that could include importing more Wyoming-produced coal, natural gas, uranium and soda ash, as well as <a href="https://wyofile.com/why-wyoming-bar-nunn-crowd-seeks-info-on-plan-to-build-portable-nuclear-microreactors/">nuclear microreactors</a> that might be manufactured here.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Prime Minister [of Japan, <a href="https://japan.kantei.go.jp/103/actions/202504/24hyoukei.html">Shigeru Ishiba]</a> said, &#8216;Look, we were [at an 80% trade imbalance with the U.S.] in the 1980s and now we&#8217;re less than 20%. So, you know, we&#8217;re anxious to work with you to rebalance,'&#8221; Gordon said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That type of interest includes potential investments by both Japan and Taiwan to expand port capacities in the U.S. and on their shores to increase the flow of Wyoming coal and natural gas to those and other Asian nations, he added.</p>



<p>Though Wyoming might see some new deals to ship energy commodities to Asian markets, Godby said, it would be despite escalating tariffs. The state may even land new manufacturing here at home, but those are long-term outcomes that first have to be built on investor confidence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hope is not a strategy,&#8221; Godby said. Even if the Trump administration pumps the brakes on tariffs completely, he added, there&#8217;s already a certain level of damage done to U.S. trade relations — and a big part of that is the fact that nobody knows what the Trump administration will do next.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;With just general uncertainty, you&#8217;re going to see [investments] go down, which is going to hurt our economy. There&#8217;s no way to win that,&#8221; Godby said. &#8220;If you really wanted to sandbag the U.S. economy, you couldn&#8217;t have done much of a better job.&#8221;</p>

<p>The majority of visitors to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks value wildlife viewing so much that they would support a park-related fee or tax toward habitat conservation, a new study finds.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study, <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.70051">“Tradeoffs and win-wins between large landscape conservation and wildlife viewing in protected areas,”</a> was published Sunday in <em>Conservation Science and Practice. </em>Along with establishing support for paying conservation fees, the paper concludes that species population declines could have a greater effect on park visitation than imposing such fees.</p>



<p>“Visitors responded that they would be likely to visit the parks less if there were fewer wildlife to see,” said co-author Hilary Byerly Flint, a researcher with the University of Wyoming’s Haub School of Environment and Natural Resources.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study looked specifically at Wyoming’s two northwestern national parks, and co-authors include Byerly Flint and Drew Bennett with the Haub School; migration researcher Arthur Middleton with the University of California, Berkeley; Leslie Richardson with the National Park Service’s economics program and Aaron Enriquez with the U.S. Geological Survey.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Authors say the study cements with data what many people already know: Seeing grizzly bears, elk, wolves or other animals in the wild is tremendously valuable to the public. So valuable that most would pony up to support conservation efforts beyond park boundaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“For the vast majority of people who visit the parks, it&#8217;s mind blowing” to see something like an elk bugling, said Scott Christensen, executive director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, which helped fund the study. “It&#8217;s almost a once-in-a-lifetime experience for them, and it has real, tangible value.”</p>

<p>The concept of a conservation fee in national parks is not new, though it has yet to gain required federal traction to be enacted. Authors hope the study can be used to continue the dialogue, Byerly Flint said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think we see this really as the start of a conversation about how to pay for conservation in these areas that are increasingly threatened,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re seeing the loss of habitat for these migratory ungulates at unprecedented rates,” Byerly Flint continued. And that leads to the question of: “How to pay for conservation of that habitat, while also maintaining the benefits and the wonderful experiences that park visitors enjoy when they come to Yellowstone and Grand Teton?”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Genesis</strong></h4>



<p>In 2018, former Wyoming State Rep. Al Sommers, a Sublette County rancher, sponsored a <a href="https://www.wyoleg.gov/Legislation/2018/HJ0005">joint resolution</a> relating to the collection of wildlife conservation fees at Yellowstone and Grand Teton. His resolution requested that the Department of the Interior and National Park Service enter into an agreement with Wyoming to collect a wildlife conservation fee at the parks to generate revenue for conservation efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Legislature passed the resolution, and Gov. Mark Gordon signed it, but those fees have not gained federal approval.</p>



<p>“My priority was conflict resolution,” Sommers told WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Whether it’s grizzly bears or wolves, or elk or, frankly, wildlife on highways,” Sommers said, the fee was envisioned as “a way to generate money from all of the public, from the national public that enjoys these wildlife in the park, to help mitigate some of the cost associated with that and to ensure wildlife’s viability.”</p>



<p>Two years later, Middleton co-authored a paper titled <a href="https://conbio.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/csp2.335">“Harnessing visitors&#8217; enthusiasm for national parks to fund cooperative large-landscape conservation,”</a> which further explored the concept. That study examined legal and political challenges and estimated that a fee of up to $10 per vehicle could generate up to $13 million annually for conservation projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new study takes the issue a step further, Byerly Flint said, by examining “what park visitors themselves think about the idea of contributing towards conservation and how important the animals that require habitat beyond park boundaries are to park visitor experiences.”</p>



<p>In summer 2022, a research assistant spent two months surveying visitors of Yellowstone and Grand Teton parks — both inside their boundaries and outside in communities like Jackson and Cody. </p>



<p>Researchers analyzed 991 responses. Just over 75% of respondents cited wildlife viewing as a primary reason for their trips to Yellowstone and Grand Teton. The majority also supported the idea of paying extra for conservation —&nbsp;with 93% supportive of a voluntary donation; 75% supportive of a tax or fee on goods and services; and 66% supportive of a mandatory wildlife conservation fee.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study also found that wildlife viewing generates an estimated $581 million in annual recreational value in the two national parks, representing a significant economic engine. Yellowstone tallied 4.74 million visitations in 2024 — the second highest year on record. Grand Teton, meanwhile, reported 3.62 million, its third highest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nearly half of respondents, furthermore, said they would take fewer trips to the parks if there were fewer wide-ranging wildlife to view. That, researchers calculated, could result in about a 15% decrease in overall park visitation.</p>

(Screengrab)
</figcaption></figure>



<p>The results illustrate support for a basic trade off, the study concludes. Visitors are willing to pony up rather than risk long-term wildlife declines. </p>



<p>“These wide-ranging wildlife, like elk and mule deer and grizzly bears, are hugely important to park visitor experiences, to the reasons they decide to visit the parks,” Byerly Flint said.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Next steps&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>Sommers’ resolution, along with a similar version passed in Montana, was nonbinding. Any change in park fees falls under the purview of the National Park Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wyoming’s park superintendents have indicated support for wildlife, Byerly Flint noted. Yellowstone Superintendent Cam Sholly declined to comment for this story; Grand Teton Superintendent Chip Jenkins didn’t respond by publication time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Byerly Flint said, the paper underscores the point that “the value of the experience within the park boundaries is contingent upon what&#8217;s happening outside of park boundaries.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Support for a fee or donation was regardless of income or politics, the report found. In terms of diminishing returns, researchers found that a cost increase of more than $75 would equate to the same reduction in visits that might result from fewer wildlife to view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The study does not mean the co-authors are set on fees as a solution, Byerly Flint said. “This is one way. This isn&#8217;t necessarily <em>the way. </em>It&#8217;s just an idea that we&#8217;re exploring.”</p>



<p>Christensen of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition echoed that sentiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Every animal that spends time in the parks also spends time outside of the parks and in these unprotected areas,” he said. “And so our interest in this study is really around trying to come up with some innovative approaches for how to pay for conservation long term. I think what this study tells us, and gives us some hope around, is that people are willing to do that … there’s a willingness there.”</p>

<p>Wyoming school districts and community interests have clashed for several years over gender identity policies and parental rights.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignleft is-style-border has-white-color has-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Opinion</h3>
</div></div>



<p>That’s not likely to end soon, despite <a href="https://wyofile.com/judge-rock-springs-school-didnt-violate-parental-rights-in-transgender-pronoun-case/">a federal judge’s well-reasoned decision</a> last week to dismiss a lawsuit filed by parents against a Sweetwater County school district that respects student requests to use their preferred name and pronouns in school. Under the policy teachers do not discuss the issue with parents unless they ask.</p>



<p>Lawmakers in Wyoming have passed several controversial gender-related bills, including a ban on transgender girls competing in sports against cisgender girls, and prohibiting gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. It’s part of a concerted far-right crusade to limit the rights of transgender youth.</p>



<p>At the heart of the Sweetwater County case is the important legal question of whether school districts must notify parents about changes in their child’s preferred name and pronouns. The “well-being” of children is typically cited, no matter what action is advocated.</p>



<p>In 2023, Rock Springs parents Ashley and Sean Willey filed a civil rights lawsuit against Sweetwater County School District No. 1, alleging it violated their rights during the 2021-22 school year by withholding information about their child’s request that the high school’s teachers and staff use a preferred male name and pronouns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The parents accused the district of keeping that news from them by continuing to use the high school student’s gender assigned at birth in their presence, while using the teen’s preferred name and pronouns in school.</p>

<p>U.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl, dismissing the lawsuit and ruling in the school district’s favor, explained why the parents’ rights weren’t violated.</p>



<p>“A respectful and nondiscriminatory school environment is a legitimate state interest,” the judge wrote. “Referring to students by preferred names and even declining to proactively inform parents to respect a student’s choice are both rationally related to that interest. Thus, the district policies and staff members’ actions pass constitutional muster.” </p>



<p>It’s a profound conclusion that has been voiced in other states, including a 2022 Wisconsin case that kept a school district&#8217;s policy intact. The Wisconsin ACLU said in an amicus brief that outing children to their families could be dangerous because <a href="https://badgerherald.com/news/madison/2022/07/19/wisconsin-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-mmsd-transgender-student-policy/">one-third of transgender children are rejected by their families</a> after coming out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the Human Rights Campaign, 22 states and the District of Columbia have laws requiring schools to provide non-discriminatory environments in which students can safely express their gender identities. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.hrc.org/resources/state-maps">Wyoming is not one of them</a>.</p>



<p>Skavdahl dismissed all of the parents’ claims, including a separate allegation that Ashley Willey, a special education teacher at another Sweetwater County school, said she didn&#8217;t follow the district&#8217;s policy to use students’ preferred names and pronouns but was never disciplined or retaliated against for her decision.</p>



<p>Still, she maintained the policy itself violated her rights to freely exercise her religious beliefs as a parent and as a teacher. Willey claimed the district’s failure to proactively inform her about her child’s gender identity changes interfered with her religious beliefs because it kept her from information she needed to counsel her child.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s a heck of a stretch, and Skavdahl noted why it&#8217;s out of bounds.</p>



<p>“A person’s constitutional right to freely exercise their own religious beliefs does not require that the state also exercise those same religious beliefs,” the judge wrote. “To conclude that the district’s failure to act in accordance with plaintiff’s religious beliefs is a constitutional violation would turn the First Amendment on its head.”</p>



<p>The Willeys asserted parents have a right to make decisions about their children’s well-being, including their physical and mental health. The judge agreed, but added there is a “laundry list of circumstances that could affect a child’s ‘well-being’ even in the slightest that would require constant, detailed information sharing from the school, with constitutional consequences.”</p>



<p>The judge noted the school district “merely respected” the student&#8217;s voluntary choices, didn&#8217;t withhold information from the parents, and when the Willeys sought it, the information was provided. Skavdahl added the district didn’t require the child to go by a preferred name or pronouns, or “discourage students from discussing their gender identities with their parents.”</p>



<p>The Willeys contended teachers facilitated the student’s gender transition socially, and invalidated the parents’ right to make medical decisions for their teen. But Skavdahl wrote there was no evidence the school provided any type of medical transition or social transitioning, “and defendants were not involved in changing the student’s clothing or hairstyle.”</p>



<p>I don’t think parents should blame the school district or teachers for not voluntarily providing answers to every question they have about their child, including gender identity. Educators are frequently reminded by parents that while they are paid to instruct their child during school hours, parents are primarily responsible for their well-being, medical needs, instilling religious values, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I find it improbable that a parent who may question a change in their child’s appearance or behavior can’t pick up some clues from observing their interactions with others, including family members and friends. Skavdahl is correct: parents are entitled to information about their children from educators, who must honestly answer these questions when asked.</p>



<p>But if teachers and staff are required to identify every change in a student’s “well-being” and notify each parent, not many lessons will be taught.</p>



<p>I have other concerns about how courts will handle future school gender identity cases. The Willeys’ lawsuit took two years to be dismissed. The <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/04/29/judge-sides-with-rock-springs-schools-tosses-parents-gender-transition-lawsuit/">parents, as is their right, will appeal</a>, according to their attorney.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I think it’s fair to say that across the country, the extreme right’s anti-trans campaign has picked up speed, particularly under President Donald Trump’s new administration, and public support is unfortunately waning for school district policies protecting students’ gender identities.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How this will play out in the courts is anybody’s guess. Last May the U.S. Supreme Court declined to <a href="https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/supreme-court-turns-down-case-challenging-school-districts-transgender-policies/2024/05">take up a case about a Maryland school district’s policies</a> to support transgender students and when parents may challenge them. But the high court declined it because the parents who sued did not have standing, not because of the case&#8217;s merits.</p>



<p>Several conservative groups and 17 red states filed a friend of the court brief, arguing “parents must have the right to ask for the court’s help in securing the fundamental right to know what schools are doing with their kids.” What will the conservative court do when a similar case isn’t dismissed for technical reasons?</p>



<p>In another Maryland case the U.S. Supreme Court heard last month, justices’ questions seemed to overwhelmingly favor allowing parents to opt out their children from <a href="https://foxbaltimore.com/news/local/maryland-parents-await-supreme-court-religious-liberty">language arts lessons that included LGBTQ books.</a></p>



<p>A <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2023/10/01/pronouns-schools-supreme-court-00118832">Politico article took a stab at predicting</a> how the high court will weigh the interests of transgender or gender-nonconforming children and “their public school protectors versus parents’ interests in making decisions regarding the health care, education and upbringing of their children.”</p>



<p>“It is easy to see where the trajectory is going,” Politico concluded. “Conservative ‘values’ will probably win.”Does a thoughtful ruling like Skavdahl’s stand a chance to prevail at a higher level? It deserves to and it’s a victory worth celebrating in Wyoming, but I too have little faith that in the end Trump’s conservative Supreme Court majority will allow that to happen.</p>

<p>CODY—Joe Martinez and Phillip Scheel sat in the back row of the Cody Auditorium, apart from the action that unfolded Saturday as the Wyoming Republican Party elected new leadership.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was a beautiful spring morning, but the two Thermopolis men had driven over that morning to spend the day inside, watching the party conduct its business.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martinez and Scheel watched the roll call. All 74 state central committee members — each county GOP’s chair, committeeman and committeewoman — were either present or represented by a proxy voter. Those members sat at the front of the room at tables designated by county.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two men listened to remarks by Republican elected officials praising the Trump administration, and emotional farewell speeches from party stalwarts preparing to leave the organization’s top posts. They watched as party treasurer Bob Ferguson presented outgoing Chairman Frank Eathorne with a deluxe lever-action rifle, engraved with his name on one side, the mantra “ride for the brand” on the other.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They watched the party unanimously reelect Secretary Donna Rice, who ran unopposed. They watched an election snafu resulting from miscounted ballots, which was resolved with a revote for vice chair. Ferguson won that race over Ginger Bennett.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And they watched as the party voted to elect <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-gop-to-select-new-leadership/">Bryan Miller over Rebecca Bextel</a> to replace Eathorne as chairman. Both candidates align with the further-right block of the party that gained traction under Eathorne, so the election was seen as unlikely to impact policy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Martinez and Scheel also watched as their Republican peers voted to sideline them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In March, the Hot Springs County GOP elected Martinez and Scheel its chairman and state committeeman respectively. But the validity of the election was quickly called into question when a complaint was filed with the state party, alleging that ousted precinct committee members had a right to vote due to a party bylaw. Soon after, Martinez and Scheel’s victories were overturned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The two men then <a href="https://wyofile.com/hot-springs-county-gop-sues-wyoming-republican-party-for-allegedly-interfering-in-local-elections/">filed a lawsuit</a>, alongside the county’s new vice chair and secretary, alleging the state party interfered in their local elections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Martinez and Scheel both appeared Saturday to reiterate that point. When the meeting opened for public comment, Martinez stood up from his chair to speak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I&#8217;m here because on March 17, our county did elections and they did it by law. And I just believe that we as a body are to follow the law. And we should be the ones up there representing Hot Springs County, myself and Phillip Scheel as state committeeman,” Martinez said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The party considered allowing Martinez and Scheel to cast provisional ballots, but the proposal failed in a voice vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dispute represents the latest development in a years-long debate over the extent to which the state should govern political parties — private organizations that sometimes make decisions with public implications. Eathorne expressed optimism at Saturday’s meeting that the court would treat the Hot Springs County complaint as a First Amendment issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As this litigation goes forward, this case will be about the government&#8217;s authority or not, over a private organization,” Eathorne said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This can be an exciting outcome for all of us,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How did we get here?</strong></h4>



<p>In March, an attorney for the Wyoming Republican Party advised several county parties to disregard state statute and a Wyoming Supreme Court ruling when considering who should be allowed to vote in local party elections.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Instead, the attorney advised county Republicans to follow a contested party bylaw since the matter involves a private organization.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I understand some have alleged county officers who are no longer precinct persons may not vote in your upcoming elections,” attorney Brian Shuck <a href="https://wyofile.com/in-dispute-over-local-elections-wyoming-republican-party-attorney-says-law-court-ruling-dont-apply/">wrote in a letter</a>. “They argue that, if there is conflict between a GOP bylaw and a state statute, the statute controls. I disagree.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shuck’s advice was centered on the fact that the dispute involves a private organization, which was also at the heart of a 2021 case in Uinta County.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that case, the Wyoming Supreme Court ruled that the bylaw “violated clear and unambiguous language” of state law. But because the high court did not decide whether the state law violated the party’s constitutional right to freedom of association, Shuck told county parties the bylaw — and ultimately, the U.S. Constitution — supplants state statute.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, Hot Springs County instead stuck to the law and the high court’s decision when it held officer elections. But sometime after the meeting was adjourned, Cheryl Aguiar filed a complaint with the state party.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Aguiar, former chairman of the Hot Springs County GOP and now a state committeewoman, disputed the validity of the county party’s elections and asked that the “provisional ballots” be counted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Wyoming Republican Party’s Dispute Resolution Committee sided with Aguiar. A revote including the provisional ballots followed in Hot Springs County, resulting in a new chair, Brady Harvey, and a new state committeeman, Russell Lewis.&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Saturday’s meeting&nbsp;</strong></h4>



<p>It was Harvey and Lewis who cast votes in Saturday’s leadership election in Cody, but not before some pushback. During roll call, former Sweetwater County GOP Chairman Elizabeth Bingham raised a point of order.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I move that the state central committee not accept the officers from Hot Springs County who were elected in the second, unauthorized election due to the improper use of provisional ballots and the lack of proper authority to conduct a revote,” Bingham said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>After the motion failed, Bingham made a second attempt by proposing an amendment to the rules of procedure for its officer elections. More specifically, the amendment would have allowed Martinez, Scheel and Aguiar to cast provisional ballots, which would have been set aside and kept private until the ongoing litigation is resolved.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the amendment was drafted by Shuck, Bingham said she supported it as a placeholder.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I’m not trying to be difficult. I promise, guys, I truly do believe we will not prevail in this lawsuit. I just want us to have that protection,” Bingham said. “It really is simple.”</p>



<p>Aguiar pushed back on having any provisional ballots after supporting their use at the local level.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The fact that there is a lawsuit out there that will intimidate this body to circumvent our bylaws and my right to vote on a secret ballot is disgusting,” she said.&nbsp;</p>





<p>While the amendment didn’t fix the larger issue, Sublette County Chairman and former Speaker of the House Albert Sommers stood in favor of its adoption.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The problem is that we are choosing to violate the state law. Any private organization, if they violate state law, runs up against the law,” Sommers said. “And so I&#8217;m going to stand in favor of this amendment and really against violating state law.”</p>



<p>Goshen County GOP Chairman Kirk Haas disagreed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We&#8217;re magnifying the issues that have developed in Hot Springs County,” Haas said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately, the amendment failed.&nbsp;</p>

But congressional budgeting could kill it."></a></p>
<p>As the Wyoming Legislature met in early February, a lawmaker from the state’s southwest corner announced to his fellow representatives that the Trump administration had thrown out the Bureau of Land Management’s controversial Rock Springs resource management plan, <a href="https://wyofile.com/biden-administration-finalizes-rock-springs-plan-without-further-changes/">completed just weeks before</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But word of its death, <a href="https://cowboystatedaily.com/2025/02/06/trump-administration-shuts-down-controversial-biden-era-rock-springs-management-plan/">parroted by</a> some in the media, was premature. U.S. Interior Secretary Doug Burgum’s <a href="https://www.doi.gov/document-library/secretary-order/so-3418-unleashing-american-energy">“Unleashing American Energy” order</a>, which triggered the erroneous reports, said that the <a href="https://wyofile.com/blms-final-rock-springs-plan-seeks-balance-of-resource-development-and-wildlife-protections/">final plan for 3.6 million acres</a> of the Red Desert and checkerboard region would be &#8220;reviewed and, as appropriate, revised.&#8221; Months later, the federal resource management plan remains in effect.</p>



<p>“It’s still active. It’s not frozen,” BLM-Wyoming spokesman Micky Fisher told WyoFile. “We are now just identifying possible options.”</p>



<p>What path BLM takes to satisfy Burgum’s order is being decided at the agency’s Washington headquarters, Fisher said. Amending the plan through the established National Environmental Policy Act review process is among the options, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/what-do-the-secretary-of-the-interiors-recent-orders-mean/id1395671263?i=1000698239250">policy experts have predicted.&nbsp;</a></p>



<p>Congress, however, could take away BLM’s ability to decide for itself. Wyoming’s lone U.S. Rep. Harriet Hageman has <a href="https://wyofile.com/in-new-leadership-post-hageman-takes-fresh-aim-at-federal-land-grizzly-policies/">brought such bills</a>. Her staff did not respond to a request Monday seeking comment.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Hageman-8.6.24-c.jpg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">U.S. Rep.

<p>There has also been <a href="https://wyofile.com/gop-led-congress-could-toss-rock-springs-plan-in-2025-using-an-unprecedented-move/">talk of using the Congressional Review Act</a> to overturn the land-use plan, which was <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2011/02/01/2011-2201/notice-of-intent-to-prepare-a-resource-management-plan-for-the-rock-springs-field-office-wyoming-and">nearly 14 years in the making</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet another possible route for Congress to undo the plan, which <a href="https://wyofile.com/misinformation-hysteria-dominate-response-to-blms-plan-for-sw-wyoming/">caused a political furor</a> during its draft stages, is to address it during the ongoing budget reconciliation process. That remains on the table.</p>



<p>Rep. Bruce Westerman, R-Arkansas, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee, included two provisions in his <a href="http://docs.house.gov/meetings/II/II00/20250506/118151/BILLS-119-CommitteePrint-W000821-Amdt-012.pdf">draft reconciliation bill</a> that address BLM resource management plans in Wyoming. One would not allow the BLM to “implement, administer or enforce” the RMP for its Rock Springs field office. The other includes the same prohibitionary language for BLM acting on its new plan for its Buffalo Field Office — which includes a coal-leasing ban in the Powder River Basin that’s now <a href="https://wyofile.com/wyoming-montana-sue-feds-to-repeal-powder-river-basin-coal-leasing-ban/">being litigated</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A <a href="https://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/notice_--_full_committee_markup_of_committee_print_05.06.25.pdf">markup of the draft reconciliation bill is scheduled for 8:15 a.m.</a> MST on Tuesday. Ultimately, the provisions could lead to the Rock Springs and Buffalo plans being killed by only a simple majority vote — budget reconciliation isn’t subject to the filibuster, so only 51 votes are needed to get it through the U.S. Senate.</p>



<p>That’s a possibility that has conservation groups in Wyoming on guard. Congress — via budget reconciliation or otherwise — has never successfully thrown out a federal land-use plan, said Julia Stuble, Wyoming director for The Wilderness Society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&nbsp;“We can&#8217;t find an example of this kind of congressional overreach … being successful,&#8221; Stuble said. “We’ve certainly seen some attempts at this.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not a sure thing that the resource management plan provisions will carry forward. Provisions in budget reconciliation must have a direct effect on the federal budget, and it’s unclear if congressional rules would allow for RMP provisions.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" decoding="async" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Lt.-MT-Elk-herd-sbb_14111.jpeg?w=780&#038;ssl=1" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">A large elk herd kicks up a cloud of dust as it evacuates a hillside on Little Mountain, a peak east of Flaming Gorge Reservoir within the Bureau of Land Management’s Rock Springs Field Office. (Steven Brutger)</figcaption></figure>



<p>If congressional Republicans do carry the provisions forward successfully, it’d set a bad precedent in Stuble’s view.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I think anyone who believes that the small government closest to the people is the best form of government should be opposed to this kind of overreach from Congress,” she said. “Because land-use plans, like RMPs, are developed at a local level, with tons of input from elected officials, community members and stakeholders.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Not everyone in Wyoming is on that page. Rep. Cody Wylie, a Republican representative from Rock Springs who prematurely announced the RMP’s death during the legislative session, believes that local interests were cut out of the BLM’s process. That decision charted the future of millions of acres of public land surrounding his legislative district.</p>



<p>“The way it was written, it was completely biased — not even conservation, but preservation,” Wylie said. “That’s just not realistic for the state of Wyoming. Our economy has run off of the extraction industries.” </p>



<p>Efforts to strike more of a balance between <a href="https://wyofile.com/blms-final-rock-springs-plan-seeks-balance-of-resource-development-and-wildlife-protections/">conservation and industrial development in the final plan</a> didn’t alleviate his concerns.&nbsp;</p>





<p>Wylie prefers that Congress not throw the plan out entirely, so the BLM doesn’t have to start from scratch. An amendment to the 2024 plan, he said, would be ideal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Then they can [include] all that informational work that&#8217;s been done over the last 15 years,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But if congressional Republicans successfully throw out the new plan and BLM has to revert to its 1997 RMP, he won&#8217;t protest.</p>



<p>“I think we can live with that until we redo the RMP process,” Wylie said.</p>

<p>The first police killing in the town of Thermopolis’ history started with an investigation into methamphetamine use by workers at a local McDonald’s.</p>



<p>It ended with a bloody, close-range shootout inside a trailer home after an officer shouldered his way inside without a warrant. The officer, Sgt. Michael Mascorro, suffered a gunshot wound that came harrowingly close to killing him. While bleeding profusely, Mascorro shot and killed McDonald’s employee Buck Laramore.</p>



<p>Though Laramore shot first, wounding Mascorro while the officer’s gun was still in his holster, his mother and widow sued the Thermopolis Police Department in the U.S. District Court of Wyoming this week. They allege Mascorro had no grounds to enter the trailer and that Laramore was defending himself against a police officer who was, in essence, a lawless intruder into his home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This was a completely avoidable incident,” Sweetwater County District Attorney Dan Erramouspe wrote at the time, <a href="https://www.thermopir.com/story/2023/10/12/news/mascorro-cleared-in-fatal-shooting-but-is-found-to-have-illegally-broke-into-home/13897.html">according to the Thermopolis Independent Record</a>. The prosecutor, who conducted a criminal review of the shooting and is not involved in the civil lawsuit, ruled Mascorro entered Laramore&#8217;s home illegally. Town officials later rejected that conclusion.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In their lawsuit, Laramore’s relatives cite self-defense laws like Wyoming’s controversial “stand your ground” statute and the castle doctrine, both of which generally allow homeowners to protect themselves with deadly force from an intruder. While Erramouspe found Mascorro had entered the home illegally, the prosecutor also found he was justified in shooting back at Laramore. The state’s castle doctrine carries an exception for when the intruder in one’s home is a police officer, and when the shooting started, Mascorro was defending himself, the prosecutor wrote.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The family’s lawyers disagree. “It was Mascorro’s own reckless and deliberate conduct that unreasonably created his use of force,” they wrote in the complaint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neither lawyers for the plaintiffs nor Thermopolis Police Chief Pat Cornwall responded to messages from WyoFile this week seeking comment on the case.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading">Investigation</h4>



<p>The violence on April 28, 2023 can be traced back to two days earlier, when a different Thermopolis police officer arrested a different McDonald’s employee who had an outstanding warrant. When the officer helped that employee out of her patrol car at the jail, she found a glass pipe on the car seat, according to a report on the shooting compiled by Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation agents. The employee had smoked meth from the pipe that morning with one of his McDonald’s colleagues, he told the officer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thermopolis police officers decided to contact the area health inspector, Jamie George, for a combined investigation into meth use among the McDonald’s employees. That investigation led Mascorro and a Hot Springs County sheriff’s deputy with a drug dog to the restaurant on April 28 — where Laramore had just started his work shift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mascorro found Laramore suspicious. He saw Laramore leave the men’s room, and soon afterward the drug dog detected meth hidden in containers in the bathroom’s baby changing station, according to the DCI investigation. The officer asked Laramore to take a drug test, which the McDonald’s worker declined to do. When Mascorro asked for his name, Laramore misspelled it by one letter. He also said his birth year was 1988, when it was in fact 1989.&nbsp;</p>

Michael Mascorro poses for a photograph posted to the Thermopolis Police Department website. (Thermopolis Police Department)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Laramore left the McDonald’s shortly after the exchange and returned home. When Mascorro learned Laramore had given him a misspelled name and the wrong birth year, he called a Hot Springs County prosecutor, according to an interview with the prosecutor conducted by the DCI investigators.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kelly Owens, the prosecutor, told Mascorro they could not connect Laramore to the meth in the bathroom. The officer then said he wanted to arrest Laramore for interfering with the investigation by giving false information about himself. Owens suggested Mascorro could just write Laramore a ticket instead, according to the lawsuit. </p>



<p>But Mascorro wanted to arrest Laramore, he would later tell DCI agents. </p>



<p>A two-decade veteran of the U.S. Air Force, Mascorro had joined the Thermopolis Police Department eight years prior. At the time of the shooting, he was the agency’s second in command. The DCI agents who investigated Laramore’s death asked Mascorro why he went to Laramore’s home alone. The small police department was shorthanded, Mascorro told the investigators, and he did not have an option for backup. “It’s the nature of this job,” he said, according to the DCI report.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During his tenure in Thermopolis, Mascorro had received four use-of-force complaints, according to the lawsuit. He was accused of kicking a man and knocking him to the ground while arresting him, and in another instance, of escalating an encounter into a fight at Thermopolis’s signature drinking establishment, the One-Eyed Buffalo. Just six days before the shootout, the Wyoming Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission had cleared Mascorro of any wrongdoing in those incidents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lawsuit claims the department should have corrected aggressive behavior by Mascorro, and that doing so may have prevented the fatal shootout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laramore’s McDonald’s colleagues described him to DCI agents as a “big-hearted” and good worker who sometimes felt down about life. When agents asked one colleague if Laramore was suicidal, she told them he would never kill himself because of his love for his wife.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the DCI report, however, Mascorro learned from his dispatcher on his way to Laramore’s home that the man also had a record of assault charges. Laramore was well armed — DCI agents would recover three pistols when they searched the home after the shooting. Agents also found meth, fentanyl and marijuana.</p>



<p>Mascorro arrived on Laramore’s doorstep several hours after their first encounter at the McDonald’s, according to the DCI investigation. He banged on the door, which Laramore came to but did not exit. A storm door separated the two men as they spoke. Mascorro told Laramore to come outside so he could be arrested for interference. Laramore said he would not do so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The situation would go “one of two ways,” Mascorro suggested, according to the lawsuit. Either Laramore would step outside, or Mascorro would “break the door in.”</p>



<p>Laramore closed the door of his home. Mascorro opened the storm door and began to ram the main door with his shoulder.&nbsp;</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Shootout</strong> </h4>



<p>The Thermopolis Police Department released selective portions of Mascorro’s body camera footage from the incident, accompanying the footage with narration that gives the law enforcement view of the encounter. Mascorro entered the trailer because he believed Laramore could flee out the back door, the narration suggests.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In his interview with DCI, Mascorro said he considered Laramore’s closing of the door in his face the equivalent of fleeing arrest, and felt if he left to secure a warrant, Laramore would be gone when he returned.</p>



<p>In the lawsuit, the Laramore family’s attorneys argue Buck Laramore couldn’t have destroyed any evidence in the interference case because he had already given Mascorro the false information. There was no threat to the officer’s safety when the two men talked in the doorway, and Laramore’s refusal to step outside was not a crime, the complaint argued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laramore’s wife, Brandi, was also home.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When Mascorro broke through the door, he found Laramore standing in a hallway, pointing a Smith &amp; Wesson handgun at him with both hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mascorro’s gun was still in its holster, according to the DCI report. Laramore fired once and put a .45-caliber bullet through Mascorro’s right arm and into his chest, where it broke one of the officer’s ribs and passed through his lung, narrowly missing his spine.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The shot knocked Mascorro to the ground.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Laramore advanced toward him, and according to the DCI report, likely fired another shot, though it didn’t strike Mascorro and it’s unclear where the round went.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lying on the ground, Mascorro called on Laramore to “stop, stop.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the lawsuit, Laramore did not fire another shot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mascorro told the DCI agents he did not know why Laramore did not shoot him again, in the head, while he lay on the ground. But Mascorro pulled his pistol and began firing, shooting seven times.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brandi Laramore hid in the home’s bathroom. According to the DCI report, she took the family dog into the bathroom with her. But in a frame from the body camera footage, the dog runs across the trailer floor as Mascorro, now standing, aims his gun toward Laramore.</p>

<p>It’s unclear if Mascorro hit Laramore during his first fusillade. Laramore appears to have retreated into another room of the trailer. According to the lawsuit, Laramore then stepped into Mascorro’s line of sight, now unarmed, and the officer fired three times. According to Mascorro’s interview with DCI agents, the officer believed Laramore was tactically peering around the corner and was still trying to shoot and kill him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mascorro hit Laramore with his first shot, he believed, and possibly his second.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time it was Laramore who fell to the ground and yelled, “stop, stop,” according to the lawsuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mascorro, now severely weakened by his injuries, collapsed to the floor. He was able to stagger out of the home before collapsing again in the yard, where arriving officers found him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inside the trailer, Laramore died in his wife’s arms, she told DCI agents.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Medics airlifted Mascorro to a hospital in Casper, where the officer came in and out of consciousness. When Mascorro returned to Thermopolis, he did so as a hero, welcomed with a parade, according to the Cowboy State Daily. However, after Erramouspe cleared Mascorro of any homicide charges but found he should not have entered Laramore’s home, the Peace Officer Standards and Training Commission again investigated the officer and considered decertifying him.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Decertifying an officer is the review board’s strongest and rarely used sanction — it would have prevented Mascorro from working in law enforcement anywhere in Wyoming.&nbsp;</p>



<p>POST, led at the time by former Casper police chief Chris Walsh, chose not to take that step. After a review of Erramouspe’s findings, the DCI report, state law and department policy, town officials in June 2024 decided Mascorro would return to duty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The Town believes Sgt. Mascaro did not violate policy or the law,” Thermopolis Mayor Adam Estenson said in a statement announcing the officer’s return.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I look forward to continued conversation on what policing looks like for Thermopolis into the future,” he continued.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though the shootout was the town’s first police killing, according to an October 2023 statement from Estenson, a second would soon follow. In September 2024, a different Thermopolis police officer conducting a wellness check would run into a mentally ill man, Jared Gottula, who was swinging a bat wildly in his yard. Gottula advanced on the officer’s patrol vehicle and the officer struck him with it. During the tense encounter that followed, the officer and a Hot Springs County sheriff’s deputy fired more than 20 rounds, killing Gottula.</p>



<p>A review found the officers began shooting after Gottula advanced on the deputy with the bat raised. Both officers were cleared of any wrongdoing, and to date, no lawsuit has been filed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Arbitrary response times, inconsistent fees and insufficient information on how to file a records request are why lawmakers should overhaul the Wyoming Public Records Act next session, guest columnist Marta Mossburg writes.</p>

<p>When Lander resident Tina Clifford sent a public records request in August to Fremont County seeking more detailed election information than what was already publicly available, she wasn’t sure to whom she should send it, what it would cost or how long it would take.&nbsp;</p>



<div class="wp-block-group alignleft is-style-border has-white-color has-primary-background-color has-text-color has-background"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow">
<h3 class="has-text-align-center wp-block-heading">Opinion</h3>
</div></div>



<p>Ms. Clifford&#8217;s grandson and my son are part of the same homeschool group and we started talking about her experience requesting records during one of our weekly school days. That conversation prompted this column, because&nbsp; the information about public records requests is insufficient on Fremont County&#8217;s website. When Ms. Clifford sent her request to County Clerk Julie Freese she didn’t hear back for over three weeks and emailed her again seeking an update. County Attorney Nathan Maxon returned her email and told her that two employees had thus far spent 18 hours on her request. That time would not cost Ms. Clifford, he wrote, but the remaining work would be billed to her at $70 per hour with an estimated cost of $560. He requested that she let him know if she wanted the remaining work done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Clifford’s experience is just one of many examples of the arbitrary response times, lack of transparency and sparse instructions on how or where to send a public records request in Wyoming. It’s also why the Public Records Act should be overhauled during next year’s legislative session.</p>



<p>The current <a href="https://wyoleg.gov/LSOResearch/2019/19PR002.pdf">Wyoming Public Records Act</a> requires the government to respond promptly showing receipt of the request and to release requested records no later than 30 days after sending the receipt unless good cause exists to extend the time frame. But a court ruling found that government entities may charge a “reasonable fee” for reproducing records — leaving open the possibility that different people could be charged different amounts and that counties within the state could set vastly different fees for the same type of request.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That’s why Rep. Pepper Ottman, R-Riverton, would like to see consistency across the state with specifics on how to submit requests, what can be released and fees that are consistent across the state. She’d also like the law to clearly state who is responsible for handling requests under the Wyoming Public Records Act. Ottman is hopeful reform will be debated in next year’s shortened budget legislative session.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are some of Mountain States Policy Center’s ideas to strengthen the Public Records Act:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>Don’t distinguish between requesters. Bad actors exist everywhere and there should be equal treatment for everyone.</li>



<li>Have a set fee schedule detailed in statute for everyone.</li>



<li>Process large record requests in installments, and cancel requests if the fee is not paid for the first installment.</li>



<li>Allow requestors to narrow or refine requests if the time estimate is too long and/or fees are too large.</li>



<li>Use the federal definition from the National Freedom of Information Coalition research for burdensome requests. The state’s Public Records Ombudsman could then be empowered to hear concerns from a government entity if that definition has been met.</li>



<li>Provide Wyoming’s Public Records Ombudsman with more authority to assist and mediate disputes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Some requests can’t be fulfilled by statute, including an individual’s income tax forms, school and medical records and government personnel files, among others. And some requests require a large amount of time to complete and may not be able to be finished within a 30-day time frame. But both government employees and those requesting information should have a clear understanding of their obligations, fees, timing and how the process is supposed to work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Having easily understood regulations is no guarantee that the government will comply, as evidenced by the thousands of lawsuits against the federal government for not fulfilling FOIA requests. But here in Wyoming, we can do better. Passing an enhanced Public Records Act would build trust in state and local government. In addition, state and local government agencies would do themselves a big favor by proactively posting as much information online as possible. Upfront transparency would mitigate the need for public records requests.</p>



<p>Strengthening the Wyoming Public Records Act should not be a partisan issue. Every resident deserves a government accountable to the people it serves. Legislators should prioritize it in 2026.</p>

<p>Grassy Wyoming roadsides can be enticing to grizzly bears, especially mothers with cubs, and many people can’t resist stopping to marvel at the charismatic critters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Everybody wants to see a bear. That’s the picture you want to take home from your vacation,” said Wyoming Highway Patrol Sgt. Andy Jackson.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stopping to view wildlife can be done safely, but in the heat of the moment, the trooper has written tickets to motorists for stopping in the middle of the road, leaving their car doors flung open and standing a hundred yards down the highway to take pictures.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I ask them, ‘Would you do this where you live?’ And they go, ‘Well, no,’” Jackson said. “And I go, ‘Well why would you do it here?’”</p>



<p>As bears come out of hibernation, the snow melts and grass greens up along roadsides, Jackson and his colleagues with other local, state and federal agencies are gearing up to attempt to steer humans toward safer habits when it comes to viewing wildlife.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Togwotee Pass tees up a particularly vexing mix of grizzlies, wildlife watchers, steep grades, blind corners, high speeds and troubling behavior. Local, state and federal agencies put out a joint call last week for people to follow “ethical wildlife viewing and photography practices” on Togwotee Pass. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Wyoming Game and Fish Department and U.S. Forest Service have jointly stepped up patrols and are asking the public to heed their directions to minimize traffic jams and ensure safety for humans and bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

(Mike Koshmrl/WyoFile)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Retired U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service special agent Steve Stoinski knows what a hazardous —&nbsp;and sometimes volatile — mix can be found on Togwotee Pass after <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/bye-felicia-hazing-isn-t-popular-or-pretty-but-it-s-keeping-celebrity-grizzly-away/article_17aaec9b-158f-581a-9c68-719053cc3057.html">spending the summer</a> of 2021 trying to solve the problem. Stoinski came out of retirement to work, under contract, for the Fish and Wildlife Service to intensively haze Grizzly 863, also known as Felicia, away from the roadside. Stoinski was already familiar with the grizzlies of Togwotee Pass, having previously investigated reports of drones harassing the federally protected threatened species. Although hazing briefly deterred the mother grizzly, Stoinski saw that it didn’t have a lasting effect.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The takeaways I had for managing grizzlies near the road,” he told WyoFile, “the bears are just going to hang out on the road.”</p>



<p><strong>Roadside bears</strong></p>



<p>Grizzlies have reasons to be <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/grizzly-399s-death-prompts-study-of-roadside-bear-watching/article_9cb48e1c-b1e8-11ef-921c-6b50d06ebc3c.html">next to the road</a>, whether to forage for food or for their own safety, he said. Male grizzlies tend to stay away from the highway, and female grizzlies tend to avoid male grizzlies to protect their cubs, he said. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://videos.files.wordpress.com/NadplQvQ/img_0688-2.mov"></video></figure>



<p>“I only saw one boar griz that whole summer,” Stoinski recalled. “At that time, Felicia, Bear 863, she headed out of that area as soon as she got wind of that bear and bolted across the highway. We had to stop traffic to get her across the highway.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wildlife managers no longer have Bear 863 marked, according to Game and Fish Large Carnivore Supervisor Dan Thompson. Out of an abundance of caution, Thompson didn’t want to say for certain whether the sow and two cubs frequenting the Togwotee Pass area this spring are Felicia and her offspring.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Over the years, we’ve started to wonder if 863 has turned into a different bear that just likes the road,” Thompson told WyoFile.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regardless, there’s a sow with two cubs that frequents the area. Game and Fish caught and marked one of the cubs last summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We definitely have a bear that is very observable, and it’s unfortunate we have to go back every year and remind everybody [of] etiquette and ethics when it comes to viewing them,” Thompson said.&nbsp;</p>

Never approach bears. People should maintain a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife. (Jason Wilmot/U.S. Forest Service)</figcaption></figure></div>


<p>Ethical, and legal, viewing practices include not approaching bears, maintaining 100 yards between yourself and a bear, stopping in paved pullouts — not on the shoulder — and not feeding wildlife. Though Wyoming Highway Patrol typically responds to traffic complaints, they also get called to Togwotee Pass for confrontations over bear viewing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“At times, some of the Game and Fish, some of the biologists, get harassed by the people that are bear watching,” Trooper Jackson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Already this spring, Thompson said, “we’ve had some pretty nasty confrontations from some members of the public, basically telling us we can’t tell them what to do.”</p>



<p><strong>Human nature&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Those tensions motivated multiple agencies to come together to ask the public to follow directions from law enforcement and wildlife managers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stoinski also got an earful from bear watchers and photographers in 2021 when he hazed bears away from the road.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“They were pretty belligerent,” Stoinski <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/bye-felicia-hazing-isn-t-popular-or-pretty-but-it-s-keeping-celebrity-grizzly-away/article_17aaec9b-158f-581a-9c68-719053cc3057.html">said at the time</a>. “They got in our faces, were poking me in the chest.”</p>



<p>But eventually, they overcame those initial conflicts and worked together to promote bear and human safety, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Bridger-Teton National Forest is leaning heavily into <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/r04/bridger-teton/newsroom/releases/agencies-call-upon-public-help-keep-bears-wild-and-people-safe">education and cooperation</a> to improve safety for bears and people on the highway, which is a <a href="https://dot.state.wy.us/files/live/sites/wydot/files/shared/Planning/Centennial%20Scenic%20Byway.pdf">designated scenic byway</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Along with the <a href="https://bearwisejh.org/">Bear Wise Jackson Hole program</a> and other agency partners, the national forest is asking “the public, photographers, and wildlife tour groups to lead by example.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We get that there’s a lot of opportunities to see wildlife all over the forest,” Bridger-Teton spokeswoman Mary Cernicek said. As new vegetation sprouts along roadsides, attracting bears, “we’re so excited to see them and probably having unintended consequences.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="534" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?resize=780%2C534&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-75808" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?w=1000&amp;ssl=1 1000w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?resize=768%2C526&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?resize=400%2C274&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?resize=706%2C484&amp;ssl=1 706w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Felicia-on-TogwoteeUSFS-1.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and its partners have used this photograph over the years to illustrate the dangerous mix of bears, people and traffic on Togwotee Pass. (Bridger-Teton National Forest)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Originally, Togwotee didn’t see a heavy management presence along the highway, but as bear jams escalated, wildlife managers responded with attempts to change both bear and human behavior. Game and Fish still hazes grizzlies, when possible, away from the Togwotee highway.</p>



<p>“It’s been an ongoing effort to try to keep something worse from happening,” Thompson said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If it is Felicia along the road, she has been <a href="https://buckrail.com/explainer-what-to-do-in-the-event-of-a-wildlife-vehicle-collision-2/">hit by a car</a> before, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Last fall, world-famous Grizzly 399 was <a href="https://wyofile.com/authorities-driver-hit-grizzly-399-while-going-speed-limit-killing-famous-bear-almost-instantly/">fatally struck</a> by a vehicle on the highway through the Snake River Canyon south of Jackson. The <a href="https://wyofile.com/grizzly-bear-399-struck-killed-by-vehicle-south-of-jackson/">matriarch bruin</a> had raised her cubs roadside in Grand Teton National Park for nearly two decades.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Visitors save up and come from around the world to see Wyoming wildlife — a phenomenon not limited to national parks.</p>



<p><strong>Striking a balance&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>In Wyoming, it’s illegal to park on the shoulder of a highway unless it’s an emergency, Trooper Jackson said, and people are supposed to use designated pullouts. But enforcing that law isn’t so easy.</p>



<p>He points to the hamlet of Wilson at the base of Teton Pass, where a moose can be seen most summer days from the shoulder of Highway 22.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“All summer long, we get people stopping, taking a picture of the moose in Fish Creek,” Jackson said. Wyoming Highway Patrol fields frequent complaints from people who want the cars out of there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“And I’m going, ‘These people came 2,000 miles to see this,’” Jackson said. “We try to have a good balance of what’s common sense.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Teton County Sheriff’s Office also enforces traffic laws and gets called to help out on Togwotee Pass. Sheriff Matt Carr said the county used to offer overtime pay to a deputy who lived in nearby Buffalo Valley to patrol the area more frequently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The key problem is people stopping,” Carr said. “It’s really not the tourists as much as it is the professional photographers.”</p>



<p>Carr said he no longer has that deputy or the budget to help as much as the county has in the past.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re trying to watch budgets very seriously this year with the revenue losses we’re seeing from <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/town_county/facing-6-million-deficit-state-cuts-teton-county-mulls-increasing-property-taxes/article_244684e8-eec0-440d-9cc8-ffcffddb302d.html">property tax reductions</a>,” Carr said.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Grizzly speed limit?</strong></p>



<p>Looking back on his summer managing the mayhem in 2021, Stoinski sees human nature as a major driver of behavior that can’t be overlooked.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“People coming from across the country to visit the parks, or to visit Wyoming, and they see a grizzly bear for the first time in their lives, they just can&#8217;t help but stop,” Stoinski said. “There&#8217;s got to be a balance between letting people enjoy the bears while they&#8217;re near the road without getting too close.”</p>



<p>One thing that authorities can control is the speed limit. For his part, Stoinski would like to see variable speed limits deployed when grizzlies are in the area and bear jams become unavoidable.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-pullquote"><blockquote><p>“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit.&#8221;</p><cite>Steve Stoinski, retired USFWS Special agent </cite></blockquote></figure>



<p>Wyoming has variable speed limits for blizzards along the interstate, he noted. Why not take the concept for a test drive along Togwotee?&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Maybe we ought to consider having a grizzly bear speed limit, you know when the bears are around the highway,” he said. “Slow traffic down just for people’s safety.”</p>



<p>Already, electronic signs posted along the highway tell people not to stop on the road to view bears.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p><a href="https://jhwildlife.org/">Jackson Hole Wildlife Foundation</a> Executive Director Renee Seidler encourages wildlife enthusiasts to find safer spots to view bears.</p>



<p>“The biggest issue is the road, the traffic, the speed and very little capacity to manage the crowds,” Seidler said, compared to nearby wildlife viewing hot spots in Teton Park.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Seidler also said the agencies might not have yet found the right mix of “carrot and stick.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s a recurring problem that I would love to see fixed,” she said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CODY—Two days of discussion about the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem’s grizzly population passed before anyone inquired about the status of the species the meeting was focused on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under <a href="https://wyofile.com/judge-gives-feds-45-days-to-decide-on-yellowstone-grizzly-bears-threatened-status/">a court order</a> in January, the Biden administration’s Fish and Wildlife Service <a href="https://wyofile.com/feds-yellowstone-lower-48-grizzlies-to-remain-protected-by-endangered-species-act/">proposed continuing with Endangered Species Act protections</a> in the Yellowstone region and all other portions of the Lower 48 where grizzlies reside. Shortly thereafter, pro-delisting leadership was installed by the Trump administration: <a href="https://www.jhnewsandguide.com/news/environmental/trumps-interior-pick-backs-grizzly-delisting/article_c3196be2-d45f-11ef-9f85-0bd6e149c5bf.html">Interior Secretary Doug Burgum</a> and Brian Nesvik, a former Wyoming Game and Fish Department director who’s now <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-taps-former-wyoming-game-and-fish-chief-nesvik-to-lead-u-s-fish-and-wildlife-service/">nominated</a> to lead the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For months, there’s been little official word about what’s going on with Fish and Wildlife’s proposal, though the agency <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-administration-delays-deadline-for-feedback-on-federal-protection-for-grizzlies/">delayed the deadline</a> for the public to provide feedback. In Cody this week, the topic was barely broached at the Interagency Grizzly Bear Committee’s semi-annual Yellowstone Ecosystem Subcommittee meeting. It only came up because a member of the public, local resident Dewey Vanderhoff, asked “where we’re at in the overall picture with delisting” during the meeting’s closing minutes.</p>

<p>Hilary Cooley, Fish and Wildlife&#8217;s grizzly bear recovery coordinator, pointed out the proposal on the table — and said she couldn’t say much more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“As far as what happens with that proposal, we’re waiting for leadership to be installed,” Cooley said. “Acting leadership is not interested in making decisions right now.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>As of Friday, 27 pending nominees appeared above Nesvik on the <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/nom_cal_civ.htm">U.S. Senate’s Executive Calendar</a>, which suggests the wait could drag on. The Trump administration also <a href="https://wyofile.com/muley-fanatics-founder-josh-coursey-tapped-by-trump-for-high-fish-and-wildlife-service-post/">appointed another Wyomingite — mule deer advocate Josh Coursey</a> — to a high Fish and Wildlife Service post, albeit one that doesn’t require Senate confirmation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even if expected Fish and Wildlife Service leaders don’t attempt to pull back the existing continued-listing proposal administratively, legislative efforts are underway to delist grizzly bears, <a href="https://wyofile.com/in-new-leadership-post-hageman-takes-fresh-aim-at-federal-land-grizzly-policies/">including from Rep. Harriet Hageman</a>.</p>





<p>The gathering of Yellowstone Ecosystem grizzly bear managers in Cody differed from typical meetings because of the turmoil and turnover the Trump administration has brought to the federal government via its Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency. Most federal members of the committee attended remotely due to travel and spending restrictions. There were also new faces, goodbyes and discussion about what the <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-and-musks-doge-functionally-destroying-historic-yellowstone-grizzly-science-team/">diminished Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team</a> can realistically accomplish going forward.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“One way or another, the USGS is not going to have the resources they&#8217;ve had in the past,” Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Administrator Ken McDonald told the group. “At the November meeting, we better have a plan for the following spring.”</p>



<p>Biologist Matt Gould, the study team’s new leader, told the group that, despite changes in capacity, the committee’s science arm will continue with grizzly monitoring, data collection and <a href="https://wyofile.com/the-new-way-biologists-count-yellowstone-region-grizzly-bears-explained/">administering the new population model</a> to assess bear numbers — last estimated at 1,050 in the ecosystem’s core.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Cody meeting was the last as a full-time employee for <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-and-musks-doge-functionally-destroying-historic-yellowstone-grizzly-science-team/">Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team</a> Leader Frank van Manen. The longtime federal biologist <a href="https://wyofile.com/trump-and-musks-doge-functionally-destroying-historic-yellowstone-grizzly-science-team/">retired earlier than expected</a>, though he is staying involved in an emeritus role. He helmed the group for 13 years.</p>



<p>“I know there are some challenges ahead, but keep up the good fight,” van Manen told the group. “This endeavor has been successful for 50 years, for a good reason: Agencies working together.”</p>

<p>LARAMIE—A March <a href="https://wyofile.com/appeals-court-backs-corner-crossers-in-wyoming-public-lands-case/">ruling</a> by a federal appeals court in a widely watched corner-crossing case determined that private landowners cannot bar access to public lands with fences, trespass actions or other methods.</p>



<p>Hunters, recreators and public lands advocates celebrated the ruling and its implications for the states within the 10th Circuit — Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Utah, Oklahoma and Kansas.</p>



<p>Thursday, however, Ryan Semerad, the attorney who represented the <a href="https://wyofile.com/corner-crossing/">four Missouri hunters in the </a>federal civil lawsuit, urged recreators to exercise caution and goodwill if attempting to corner cross — or step from one piece of public land to another where those two parcels meet at a common corner with two private parcels, in a checkboard pattern of ownership. Wyoming’s checkerboard spans more than 2 million acres.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“There are limitations to that decision,” Semerad said Thursday during a corner-crossing panel discussion in Laramie. “That doesn&#8217;t mean go jump on your side by side … and just have at it. It doesn&#8217;t mean you get to go on private property without permission, consent or something else. What it means is that you have reasonable access to step from one section to the next section, so long as you can be situated appropriately, you know where the monument marker is, you know where you&#8217;re going and you respect that.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img data-recalc-dims="1" loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="780" height="622" onerror="if (typeof newspackHandleImageError === 'function') newspackHandleImageError(this);" src="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?resize=780%2C622&#038;ssl=1" alt="" class="wp-image-89490" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?resize=1024%2C817&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?resize=300%2C239&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?resize=768%2C612&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?resize=400%2C319&amp;ssl=1 400w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i0.wp.com/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Corner-crossing-crop-1024x817.jpg?w=370&amp;ssl=1 370w" sizes="auto, (max-width: 780px) 100vw, 780px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">The first corner the hunters crossed was marked by T-posts chained together, signs and a survey monument. (Wyoming Backcountry Hunters and Anglers)</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are also outstanding questions for landowners, said Wyoming Stock Growers Association Executive Vice President Jim Magagna, another panelist. His group filed an amicus brief in the case in support of the landowner who sued the Missouri hunters for stepping over, but never touching, Elk Mountain Ranch property.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“It’s pretty clear that you cannot deny access to these checkerboard lands,” Magagna said. “Does that mean that you have to allow crossing at every corner? If I want to identify one of the four corners that I control as the access point, do I have the liberty to do that? Or if I want to designate a path through the middle of my private land in lieu of granting access across the corners?</p>



<p>“Those are many of the questions that still remain out there to be addressed,” Magagna said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As they talked, it became clear that interpretations of the ruling still vary widely. But both urged common sense and respectful communication —&nbsp;traditional tenets of Wyoming hunting etiquette regarding private landowners.</p>



<p>“We need to remember that it&#8217;s a culture of cooperation with these lands, and that&#8217;s how this is going to work moving forward,” Semerad said.</p>



<p>The panel was part of the Wyoming Outdoor Recreation Summit, a two-day event bringing together outdoor recreation business leaders, public lands agency officials, nonprofits and others to strengthen the burgeoning industry and enhance access to resources. The summit is one product of newly expanded state government support of the outdoor recreation —&nbsp;Wyoming’s Office of Outdoor Recreation helps put it on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Appropriately, the panel addressed a legal question that has captivated recreators in Wyoming and the nation.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Hunters, a wealthy landowner, trespass charges</strong> </h4>



<p>In 2020, hunters Brad Cape, John Slowensky and Phillip Yeomans corner crossed to hunt on Elk Mountain, then did so again with Zach Smith in 2021.</p>



<p>Carbon County ranch owner Fred Eshelman sued the four men in 2022 for passing through the airspace above his property on their way to hunt.</p>



<p>Eshelman sued to block them, and anyone else, from corner crossing to reach some 11,000 acres of federal and state land enmeshed in his 50-square-mile ranch, a coveted hunting ground known for its abundant wildlife.</p>

(IU.S. 10th Circuit Court of Appeals)</figcaption></figure>



<p>That set off a series of court challenges and appeals in a case that involved everything from the limits of private property rights to the extent of airspace and the legality of preventing the public from accessing public land.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With implications not only for the 2.4 million acres of “corner-locked” land in Wyoming, but also for 8.3 million acres across the West, the case gained national attention, particularly among hunters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It culminated in March with the appeals court decision. In a unanimous opinion, the three-judge panel sided against Eshelman, citing an act of Congress that preempts Wyoming trespass law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Congress enacted the Unlawful Inclosures Act in 1885. “No one may completely prevent or obstruct another from peacefully entering or freely passing over or through public lands,” the act says, according to the appellate judges.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The act, which explicitly prohibits “obstructing transit over public lands by force, threats, intimidation, or by any fencing or inclosing,” supersedes Wyoming trespass law, the judges ruled.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What that means in practical terms, Semerad said Thursday, is this: “You can now step from one section of public land to the next. In Wyoming, there is no state law, statute or regulation that can stop you; the federal law would preempt it.”</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Questions remain </strong></h4>



<p>Magagna believes the ruling is aimed explicitly at the checkerboard — not islands of public land surrounded by private land elsewhere, he said Thursday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Semerad disagreed. “The Unlawful Inclosures Act applies to all public lands,” he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moderator Dan McCoy, director of the Jay Kemmerer WORTH Institute, asked if the Wyoming Legislature or the state could have a bearing on the issue.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Legislature’s Travel, Recreation, Wildlife and Cultural Resources Committee will discuss corner crossing when it holds an interim meeting June 5-6 in Dubois.&nbsp;</p>

(Steven Brutger)</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though the ruling clearly states the Unlawful Inclosures Act is supreme, Magagna said, “I think where there is opportunity, potentially for the Legislature should they choose to do so, is to better define the tools that are available and the limitations on the use of those tools.” He also brought up land exchanges by which more public land could become accessible without the necessity of corner crossing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what should recreators do if they come across a corner that’s fenced off, McCoy asked.</p>



<p>“If you come across a fenced corner, call me, call the U.S. Attorney’s office because that&#8217;s unlawful,” Semerad said. “That is straight up a violation of the Unlawful Inclosures Act.”</p>



<p>The March decision might not be the final word in the corner-crossing case. There is a chance it will be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, Semerad said. The earliest the high court could see it is next winter, he said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the meantime, both men stressed a spirit of collaboration when it comes to public land users and private property owners.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>





<p>“Respect and cooperation is always going to take us much further than if we&#8217;re just going to be battling it out all the time,” Semerad said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The real answer to all this, to me and I think to many people I represent,” Magagna added, “is the relationships we build in Wyoming with people, between private landowners and the recreation and outdoor community, particularly the sportsmen, hunters and fishermen. So I think that the key thing, for now at least, is to build those relationships.”&nbsp;</p>
